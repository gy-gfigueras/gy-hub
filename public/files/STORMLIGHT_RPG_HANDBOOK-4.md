```
Permanent injuries won’t heal without supernatural
intervention, but your character can adapt to injuries,
including permanent ones. Losing a limb or use of
a sense you’re accustomed to can certainly present
practical challenges, but you can adapt with training,
practice, specialty fabrials, or the support of loved ones.
Injuries Versus Disabilities
While characters can suffer injuries during their
adventures, each player has the freedom to reject any
injury effect and choose something else that fits their
story. This game’s injury rules aren’t intended for use
when creating new characters with disabilities, nor
to model how characters with disabilities operate in
this game.
For example, if you create a character who doesn’t
have full use of all senses (such as a blind character),
you don’t gain the Disoriented condition. Instead,
you follow the general character creation rules (unless
you choose otherwise), since you’re assumed to have
various techniques and tools for navigating daily life.
Narratively, you might have certain logical limitations
due to being unable to see—but you also have certain
advantages, such as not relying on sight and not being
deceived by purely visual illusions. If your character
uses a mobility device such as a freechair fabrial (see
chapter 7), your movement rate is determined by
your character’s Speed attribute, just as it is for any
character.
Similarly, if you suffer a permanent injury during
your adventures, you might eventually learn to compen-
sate, removing the effects of any conditions it applied.
In the story, you still experience the injury’s narrative
effects, but you’ve found ways of adapting, and to
represent that, you might even remove that injury’s
mechanical condition.
```

Minor NPCs and Injuries
If a minor NPC suffers an injury, they’re immediately
defeated. When it fits the story, the PC inflicting the
injury can choose whether the NPC dies or simply
becomes Unconscious with an injury. If Unconscious,
the NPC can’t regain consciousness until they recover
at least 1 health from another source; unlike PCs, NPCs
can’t choose to regain consciousness on their own.
At the GM’s discretion, NPCs significant to the scene
or wider story might not be defeated when they suffer an
injury, potentially allowing them to be revived by allies
and rejoin the fight.

Recovering From Injuries
Temporary injuries heal after the specified duration—
or if you recuperate during downtime, you heal twice
as fast (see “Downtime” earlier in this chapter). A few
talents and other effects can also heal an injury.

```

```
Chapter 9: Adventuring 297
```

```
Death and Infusions
If you die, your active surge effects end if they don’t
require spending Investiture each round. However, any
other infused surges on your body or objects continue
until the infusions run out of Investiture.
```

```
Portraying Injuries and Disabilities
If you suffer an injury, you’re encouraged to research
the ways real people have adapted to similar injuries and
disabilities, then try to realistically portray them without
stereotypes. Autobiographical sources provide the best
insight. While the GM might work with you to suggest
the mechanical implications of an injury, you should
lead this discussion—and unlike most areas of gameplay,
you always have final say regarding how an injury affects
your character.
```

```
Stormlight and Disabilities
Stormlight has the power to heal nearly any wound
(as with the Wound Regeneration talent of the
Progression surge). However, this healing occurs by
aligning your physical self with your spiritual self—
so unless a character wants an aspect of themselves
to change, there’s nothing for Stormlight to mend.
For example, some people’s disabilities are part of
their identity; in such a case, it’s possible that Storm-
light wouldn’t heal them because they’re already whole.
```

```
Death
Player characters in this game are hardy and can
usually withstand multiple grievous injuries before
succumbing to them. However, as described in “Injury
Rolls,” each of your character’s injuries applies a penalty
to future injury rolls, significantly increasing their
chances of death.
When your character dies, they can cling to
consciousness just long enough to speak their final
words: imparting one last wisdom, making one last
quip, or saying one last goodbye. Their Cognitive
aspect then leaves their physical form, remaining in
Shadesmar for a short period before their soul rejoins
the Spiritual Realm from whence it came.
Once this scene ends, you might wish to describe
your character’s soul passing into the Beyond. This
is an opportunity for a more introspective, peaceful
farewell. Whether your character expects to join the
fight to reclaim the Tranquiline Halls or to slip gently
into nothingness, this is the end of their journey, and
their final destination remains unknown.
Returning to Life
In rare circumstances, powers such as the Old Magic
can reattach a lingering soul to its body. The more
Invested a person is at the time of their death, the
longer their soul lingers. However, a soul must be
willing to be reattached.
```

```
GM Tip: Placing PCs in Mortal Danger
In some tabletop roleplaying games, death is just an
inconvenience—but in Stormlight stories, aside from a few
exceptional cases, death is permanent. With that in mind,
GMs should be thoughtful about when to put characters
in truly mortal danger.
Out of combat, if a player makes a choice that would
lead to the certain death of a PC, consider giving them an
out-of-character warning. In combat, this game’s injury
system offers meaningful risks and consequences other
than death. However, a player may wish to tell a story of
noble sacrifice, in which case their character might choose
to fight through injuries and place themself in harm’s way!
But that’s the result of player choice, which usually creates
a far more satisfying end than does a death to random
chance.
```

**298** Chapter 9: Adventuring

###### Resting

```
In between scenes, you’ll (hopefully) find time to
rest and recuperate. This gives you an opportunity to
recover, eat, tend to your wounds, and plan for the days
ahead. There are two types of rests: short rests and
long rests.
```

```
Short Rest
A short rest is any uninterrupted period of an hour or
longer in which you’re able to relax, recover, and tend to
your wounds.
Recovering Health and Focus
After a short rest, you can roll your recovery die to
determine how well you recover (see “Willpower” in
chapter 3 to determine the size of your recovery die).
Add the roll result to your current health, your current
focus, or a combination of the two. For example, if
you roll a 5 on your recovery die, you might choose
to recover 3 health and 2 focus.
```

```
Alternative Benefits
If you prefer, you can forgo recovery yourself, and
instead spend your rest time to gain one of the follow-
ing benefits:
Tend to Others. You can provide medical assistance to
one or more willing allies you’re resting with. When
you do, they add your Medicine modifier to their
recovery die roll.
Forage. You can use Survival to forage for resources
(see “Survival” in chapter 3).
Other. If you want to accomplish tasks while the rest of
your party rests, you can forgo the benefits of resting to
try to get things done. In general, anything that would
require a skill test is too demanding to accomplish
while also getting rest.
```

```
Other Short Rest Effects
Some talents and other effects allow you to use or
activate them during or after a short rest. Unless
otherwise specified, you can benefit from these even
if you also recover health and focus (or engage in one
of the alternative activities).
```

```
Long Rest
A long rest is any uninterrupted period of eight
hours or longer in which you experience meaningful
rest. This typically involves some time for relaxation
and a full night’s sleep—or a half day’s sleep, since
missions behind enemy lines require finding sleep
wherever you can.
```

```
Recovering Health and Focus
After a long rest, you recover all your lost health and
focus. Additionally, your Exhausted penalty reduces
by 1 (see “Conditions”).
Other Long Rest Effects
As with short rests, some talents and effects activate
when you rest, and you can recover during the same
rest you benefit from those.

## Combat

```
You can change your choice each round, and your
decision doesn’t need to be made at the start of the
round. If other PCs have resolved their fast turns and
you decide you also want to act fast, you can decide in
that moment to take the next turn.
You’re encouraged to coordinate with other players
who are taking the same kind of turn as you. If you can’t
decide who should go when, the characters with the
highest Speed go first; on a tie, whoever rolls highest
on a d20 goes first.
```

```
Turn Phases
Each round of combat follows this sequence:
```

**1. Fast PC Tu r n s.** Any PCs who want a fast turn
go in any order, gaining two actions each (plus
one reaction).
**2. Fast NPC Tu r n s.** The GM chooses which
adversaries or other NPCs want a fast turn and
decides what order they go in. These NPCs gain
two actions each (plus one reaction).
**3. Slow PC Tu r n s.** The remaining PCs take their
turns, gaining three actions each (plus one reaction).
**4. Slow NPC Tu r n s.** The remaining enemies and
other NPCs take their turns, gaining three actions
each (plus one reaction).
**5. Begin the Next Round.** Once every character
has taken one turn, the round ends and the next
one begins. Repeat these steps until the combat
is resolved.
**Allied NPC Turns**
If allied NPCs are fighting alongside the PCs, they take
their turns at the same time as the enemy NPCs. It’s up
to the GM when those NPCs act during that phase.

ar has defined Roshar throughout its
history, and with the coming of the
True Desolation, it now consumes the
continent. No matter where your adventures bring you,
you’ll need to use sword, spear, and surge to protect
yourselves, your allies, and your Ideals.
When conflict breaks out that requires more resolu-
tion than just a skill test or two, it becomes a combat
and follows the rules in this chapter. This might be
a massive battle with many combatants with various
motivations, a one-on-one duel between two Alethi
nobles, or even a nonviolent scene where seconds and
positioning matter.
```

###### Order of Combat

```
In a fight, everyone acts simultaneously and every
second counts. To represent this, this game divides
time into a series of rounds. During each round,
the PCs, enemies, and other participants each get a
chance to take one turn , during which they can act
in a variety of ways.
```

```
Rounds and Turns
Each round, you can choose to take a turn that’s either
fast or slow. Your choice grants you a certain number of
actions, which represent the many things you can do on
your turn (see “Gaining Actions and Reactions”):
Taking a Fast Turn. If you act fast, you take your turn
first before any enemies go, but you only get two
actions ( ) to use on your turn.
Taking a Slow Turn. If you instead act slow, you act
after any fast enemies, but you get three actions ( )
instead of two.
```

```

```
Gaining Actions and Reactions
Most things you can do during each round are cate-
gorized as either an action or reaction. The upcoming
“Actions and Reactions” section details what you can do
with each of these.
Gaining Reactions
At the start of combat, unless you’re Surprised, you gain
a reaction ( ), which you can use any time before the
start of your first turn.
Additionally, at the start of each of your turns, you
gain a new reaction, regardless of whether you took a
fast or slow turn. (Some talents and other abilities can
grant an additional reaction.)
Each reaction lasts until the start of your next turn
(or until you use it). You can use it to respond to specific
triggers at any point in a round, either on or off your
turn; this represents your ability to instinctively respond
to someone or something on the battlefield.
Gaining Actions
At the start of each of your turns, you gain a certain
number of actions (), which represent tasks you can
undertake only on your turn. As discussed earlier in
this section, the number of actions you gain depends
on what kind of turn you choose: for a fast turn, and 
for a slow turn. (Some talents and other abilities can
grant additional actions.)
Actions can only be taken during your turn, so any
remaining at the end of your turn are lost.
```

```
Ten Heartbeats
A single round of combat can take a while to resolve, but it
represents only moments passing in the story. From a rules
perspective, the players conduct their turns in sequence,
but this is merely a practical way to organize everyone’s
decisions. From the perspective of your story unfolding on
Roshar, you and those around you all act simultaneously in
a chaotic mess of battle.
If your group needs to know a battle’s exact timing
because it matters to an element of the narrative, assume
each round of combat takes about ten seconds.
```

```
Surprise
Many combats begin with one side ambushing the other.
Other times, some characters in the scene might just
be caught totally unaware when the fight breaks out.
In these cases, the unsuspecting characters gain the
Surprised condition.
The GM determines who is Surprised at the start of
a combat. If one side is trying to be stealthy or deceptive
ahead of the fight, they might test their Stealth against
the other party’s Perception, or their Deception against
the other party’s Insight. Any opposing character who
fails to notice becomes Surprised.
After each character’s first turn, they remove the
Surprised condition.
```

###### Actions and Reactions

```
Nearly everything you do in combat takes time, so there
are limits on how much you can do each turn. You’ll
track this by using the actions and reactions you get at
the start of your turn (which run out quickly), along
with free actions (which you can use more freely).
The actions, free actions, and reactions presented
in this section are available to all characters, including
your enemies. Talents and other effects can grant
you additional options for your actions, free actions,
and reactions.

GM Tip: Combat Rules in Other Scenes
Many of the rules in this chapter can be useful out of com-
bat, though they won’t be an exact fit. For example, many
actions (and their rules) can be helpful in conversations
and endeavors, but time flows differently in those scenes,
so characters don’t take fast or slow turns to determine
how many actions they get. In and out of combat, work
with your players to use whatever rules help with the
current scene and story.
```

**302** Chapter 10: Combat

```
Interact ( )
You quickly interact with an object you can reach.
Unlike the Use a Skill action, this action usually doesn’t
require a skill test. For example, you might Interact to:
```

◆ (^) Open or close a door.
◆ (^) Pick up an item.
◆ (^) Draw or sheathe your weapon.
◆ (^) Retrieve something from your pack.
◆ (^) Pass something to an ally.
◆ (^) Quickly scarf down pancakes.
◆ (^) Put on or take off a simple piece of clothing.
You can use the Interact action more than once per turn.
Move ( )
You move a distance up to your movement rate.
If you’re crawling, climbing, swimming, or being
stealthy, you become Slowed for this movement,
reducing how far you can move. Leaping or climbing
as part of your movement might require an Agility
or Athletics test.
You can use the Move action more than
once per turn.
Strike ( )
You attack using an unarmed attack or a weapon you’re
wielding against the Physical defense of a target.
You can use the Strike action more than once
per turn, but each attack must use a different hand.
If you attack using your off hand, you must
spend 2 focus.
Use a Skill ( )
You use one of your skills to perform challenging tasks
around the battlefield—for example, you could make
a Perception test to search the environment, make a
Stealth test to hide, or make a Medicine test to treat
an ally. This action covers many creative tasks you
might attempt.
If you have an idea that you don’t feel fits into this
action, see the “Improvising Actions” sidebar for
more options.
**Special Maneuvers and Precise Shots**
You aren’t limited to a single way of using your weapons—
feel free to come up with unconventional moves. The
“Creative Maneuvers” section later in this chapter offers
guidance on creatively using your weapons.
Actions
**Actions** (marked by ) can only be used on your turn
in combat, and each named action can only be used
once per turn unless stated otherwise. The same applies
to actions from talents and other effects, regardless of
whether those are given a specific name.
Some actions take more time than others. Each
action in this book lists how many you must spend
to activate it: either , , or. (See “Order of
Combat” for rules on how many actions you can use
on your turn.)
On your turn, you can spend your available to use
any of the actions listed below, or to use any actions
granted by your talents or other effects (such as the
Breathe Stormlight action available to Radiants).
Brace ( )
You hide behind cover within 5 feet of you (see
“Terrain”) to defend yourself against incoming attacks.
All attacks against you gain a disadvantage for as long as
you stay behind cover. If you attack or move, the benefits
of this action end.
You’re only protected against attacks from the other
side of your cover, and it must be substantial enough to
realistically defend you against the attack. For example,
you could press yourself against a wall or duck behind
an obstacle, but if an enemy rounds the corner toward
you, they can attack you without disadvantage.
If you have a weapon with the Defensive trait (such
as a shield), you can wield it to create mobile cover for
yourself. When you do, you must keep that weapon
raised and between yourself and any potential attackers.
Disengage ( )
You carefully step away from an enemy, defending
yourself so they can’t seize the opportunity to attack.
Move 5 feet without triggering Reactive Strikes.
Gain Advantage ( )
You use one of your skills to seek the upper hand
over your opponent, such as through clever tactics,
unexpected feints, or superior strength. Explain how
you are doing so, then make a test using a relevant
skill against the enemy’s corresponding defense. On a
success, you gain an advantage on your next test against
that enemy that uses a different skill. For example, you
can test Deduction test to guess at your foe’s next move,
then use that advantage on your next Light Weaponry
test; however, you can’t test Light Weaponry then
use that advantage on another Light Weaponry test.
(See “Skills” in chapter 3 for more examples of tests
to Gain Advantage.)
Chapter 10: Combat **303**

```
Shove ( )
Through strength and skill, you forcibly maneuver your
opponent. Make an Athletics test against the Physical
defense of a character within your reach. On a success,
you push or pull the target 5 feet horizontally. If you
successfully Shove a character who has grappled you,
it ends the Grapple effect.
```

```
Free Actions
Free actions (marked by ) follow the same rules as
other actions, except they don’t use one of your available
actions. Unless a condition or other effect currently pre-
vents you from taking actions, you can use an unlimited
number of different free actions on your turn.
However, like actions, each free action (including
those from talents and other effects) can only be used
once per turn unless stated otherwise.
```

```
Banter ( )
You can freely speak at any point during your turn, and
other characters can briefly respond. However, because
each round is only about 10 seconds of time, the GM
might limit you to only a couple sentences per turn.
If you wish to use speech in a more nuanced way
(such as to persuade someone or do something else that
would require a skill test), this demands enough of your
attention that you must instead Use a Skill to do so.
Drop ( )
You drop any number of objects you’re holding in your
hands or another appendage. (If you want to do so on
someone else’s turn, you must use the Ready action.)
```

```
Reactions
Reactions (marked by ) are used to respond to
specific event, known as a trigger , that happens on the
battlefield. Each reaction describes its specific trigger.
Though reactions can be triggered on your turn,
they’re typically triggered on another character’s turn
in response to something they do.
You usually only have one reaction per round.
If an effect grants you more than one reaction at
a time, you can’t simultaneously use both of your
reactions on the same trigger, but you can use the
same type of reaction on two separate triggering
events (for example, you can use Aid on two separate
tests an ally makes on their turn).
You can spend your available to use any of the
reactions listed below, or to use any reactions granted
by your talents or other effects.
```

```
Grapple ( )
Through strength and skill, you grab your opponent
or control their movements to keep them restrained
and focused on you.
Make an Athletics test against the Physical defense
of a character within your reach. On a success, they
become Restrained until either you become Uncon-
scious, you choose to end the effect (), or they are
no longer within your reach.
```

```
Ready ( *)
You prepare to respond to something happening on the
battlefield. Choose the trigger you’re waiting for (such
as a character using a certain action or gaining a certain
condition) and choose the action (or free action) you
want to use in response. If that trigger occurs before the
start of your next turn, you can use the chosen action in
response to the trigger, even if it’s not your turn. If you
choose not to respond to the trigger, you don’t regain
your spent actions.
Your readied action must follow all other rules as
if you were using it on your turn. For example, if you
already used a Disengage action, you can't ready a
second Disengage action.
* To use this action, you must use for the Ready action
itself, plus the number of required for the action you
chose to prepare.
```

```
Recover ( )
You take a deep breath and steel yourself. Roll your
recovery die to recover health and/or focus, as if you
just finished a short rest.
You can only use the Recover action once per scene.
```

```
Improvising Actions
This game’s combat rules can help you coordinate many
variables in a complex and chaotic scene, but ultimately,
rules exist to support you and your character’s story. Your
character can accomplish—or at least attempt—nearly
anything you can imagine, so don’t feel limited by just the
actions in this book.
If you want to attempt something creative, describe it
to your GM. Many things can be covered by broad actions
such as Use a Skill, but for those that can’t, your GM will
give you guidelines on whether a task is possible and how
to determine whether it works.
```

**304** Chapter 10: Combat

Aid ( )
You step in to help an ally. Before an ally makes a skill
test, you can use this reaction and spend 1 focus to grant
them an advantage on their test.
To aid an ally, you must be prepared and in range
to realistically assist them. For example, you might
aid their attack by flanking and distracting an enemy
you’re engaged with, or if you’re within speaking
distance, you might coordinate with them to search
for a hidden enemy.

Avoid Danger ( )
When you’re imperiled by your surroundings—such as
standing under a falling boulder or being shoved off a
balcony—you can use this reaction to attempt to save
yourself. This might allow you to catch yourself before
you fall, to dodge out of the way of a boulder, or to
similarly avoid the danger.
Make an Agility test to avoid the danger. If doing so
in reaction to a test (such as an attack or Shove action)
the DC is equal to that test’s result. Otherwise, the
DC is 15. If you fail, you don’t avoid the danger. If you
succeed, you avoid the danger to a reasonable degree,
as determined by the GM.
For example, if you’re trying to avoid an area attack
from the Division surge, the GM might say you move
5 feet on a success—if this movement gets you out of the
area, you aren’t hit, but if the area is larger, you’ll likely
still be affected to some degree. The more narrative-
focused the danger, the more likely you can entirely
avoid it, but any potential damage or repercussions
are at the GM’s discretion.

Dodge ( )
Before an enemy targets you with an attack, you can use
this reaction and spend 1 focus to add a disadvantage
to their attack test. You can’t use this reaction on area
attacks or on those that target multiple characters,
though you might be able to Avoid Danger and move
out of the way.

Reactive Strike ( )
As an enemy retreats, you use the opening to attack.
When an enemy voluntarily leaves your reach, you can
use this reaction and spend 1 focus to make a melee
weapon attack against the enemy’s Physical defense.
You can’t use this reaction to attack a character who
transports themself with Transportation or who
otherwise moves instantaneously.

###### Attacking

```
When you attack a target, you roll to see how well your
attack hits. These attacks can be weapon attacks made
with the Strike action, special attacks granted by talents,
or even attacks that use the powers of the surges.
Attacks always include an attack test. This is
a special kind of skill test with a few extra rules,
as described in “Making an Attack.” The primary
distinction between attacks and other skill tests is
that attacks are meant to deal damage to their target.
```

```
Making an Attack
All attacks follow these steps unless otherwise specified:
```

**1.** Choose your target.
**2.** Roll the attack test and damage dice.
**3.** Resolve damage.

```
Step 1: Choose Your Target
When you use an ability to make an attack, choose one
or more eligible targets.
Number of Ta rgets. Most attacks only target one
character at a time, but some allow multiple targets.
Melee Attacks. If you’re making a melee attack,
your target must be within your reach.
Ranged Attacks. If you’re making a ranged attack,
your target can be anywhere within the specified range.
Eligible Ta rgets. Many attacks, including
weapon attacks, require line of effect. You might gain
a disadvantage on your attack test if you can’t also
sense the target. See the upcoming “Targeting and
Range” section (along with your ability’s rules) for
more information on choosing a target.
```

```
Step 2: Roll the Attack
Test and Damage Dice
After choosing your target, make a skill test against their
specified defense. Each ability specifies which skill that
attack test uses (for weapon attacks, see the Weapons
table in chapter 7), along with which defense determines
the test’s DC. For example, the Strike action is against
Physical defense, while the Assassin’s Startling Blow is
against Cognitive defense.
Damage Dice. At the same time as you roll the
usual dice for your skill test, also roll the number of
damage dice specified in the attack. But don’t add
these damage dice to your test result—you’ll calculate
them separately to see how much damage you deal.
```

```
Chapter 10: Combat 305
```

```
Unarmed and Improvised
Weapon Attacks
Though not made with standard weapons, rules for
unarmed attacks and improvised weapon attacks are
presented in the “Weapons” section of chapter 7.
```

```
Melee Attacks
Attacks against targets next to you are melee attacks.
These must be made against a target within your
reach—typically within 5 feet of you, as described in
the upcoming “Effect Range” section. Some weapons
extend your reach further.
If you use a ranged weapon to attack a target next to
you, this isn’t considered a melee attack; see “Ranged
Attacks and Reach” for these attacks.
If your melee weapon has the Thrown trait, you can
also use it to make a ranged attack.
```

```
Ranged Attacks
Ranged attacks include firing ranged weapons,
throwing weapons with the Thrown trait, or even
Lashing objects toward your opponent with Stormlight.
These must be made against a target within the weapon
or attack’s specified range (see “Targeting and Range”).
Ranged Attacks and Reach
When you make a ranged attack while you’re within
reach of any enemy, your attack gains a disadvantage,
as you must carefully avoid giving the nearby enemy
an opening.
When you make a ranged attack against a target who
is within 5 feet of your ally, raise the stakes on the attack
test. If this attack misses your target and you roll a
Complication, the GM can spend it to make your attack
automatically graze your ally (without spending focus).
```

```
Unstable Footing
If you have unstable footing —such as when swim-
ming, flying in open air, or standing on a precarious
perch—your ranged attack gains a disadvantage, as
you must carefully stabilize yourself.
```

```
Attacks With Multiple Targets
Some attacks have multiple targets. For these attacks,
roll your attack test and damage dice once as usual,
then compare the results to the corresponding
defense of each target, determining the result for
each target individually. To graze multiple characters
who you missed, you must spend 1 focus per target
you want to graze.
```

```
Step 3: Resolve Damage
The result of your skill test determines how much
damage you deal to the target:
Miss. If your test fails, you miss the target, dealing no
damage. (However, when this happens, you can decide
to graze them instead.)
Graze. When you miss one or more targets, you can
spend 1 focus per target of your choice to instead
graze them. When you do, deal damage equal to the
total rolled on the damage dice.
Hit. If your test succeeds, you hit the target. Deal
damage equal to the total rolled on the damage dice +
your modifier for the skill you used for the test.
Critical Hit. When you hit with an attack, you can find
a weakness by spending , changing the hit into a
critical hit. This maximizes the result of your damage
dice against all targets of that attack: treat all damage
dice as if they rolled their highest number.
```

```
Weapon Attacks
The most common way to attack is using a weapon,
usually via the Strike action or your talents. When you
make a weapon attack, choose either an unarmed attack
or a weapon you’re currently wielding in your hand. The
Weapons table in chapter 7 specifies which skill to test
and which damage dice to roll for each weapon.
To attack a target with a weapon, they must be within
your reach (for melee attacks) or within the weapon’s
specified range (for ranged attacks), and they must be
in your line of effect (see “Targeting and Range”).
```

```
Wielding Multiple Weapons
The “Wielding Weapons” section of chapter 7 presents
rules for making attacks using weapons in your main
hand and off hand.
```

```
Damage Types and Deflect Value
Each attack specifies the type of damage it deals. All
damage types have the same basic effect, but some
enemies might have special protections (or weaknesses)
against certain damage types, causing it to do less (or
more) damage to them.
Remember that if your attack deals impact, keen, or
energy damage, that damage is reduced by the target’s
deflect value. For more information on damage types, see
“Damage, Injury, and Death” in chapter 9.
```

**306** Chapter 10: Combat

```
ARI IBARRA
```

```
Heavy weapons tend to favor maneuvers that
damage things in the environment, drive back foes,
or otherwise take advantage of the weapon’s weight and
reach. When testing Heavy Weaponry, the GM might
apply fewer disadvantages to maneuvers that exploit
these strengths.
Light weapons tend to favor precise maneuvers
like cutting an important item free of the target’s
belt or targeting a specific part of their body. When
testing Light Weaponry, the GM might apply fewer
disadvantages to these sorts of maneuvers.
For example, you might want to disarm your foe
by thrusting precisely at their sword arm. If the GM
agrees that maneuver makes sense, they might ask you
to attack against your foe’s Cognitive defense, gaining
one disadvantage if you’re using a light weapon, or two
disadvantages if you’re using a heavy weapon.
```

###### Targeting and Range

```
Many attacks, talents, and other abilities can only affect
certain types of characters or objects, or only affect
targets within a certain distance. Some of the following
limitations primarily matter in combat, but if you’re
using an ability in a conversation or endeavor, it’s up
to the GM whether the same rules apply.
```

Area Attacks
**Area attacks** target all characters (or a specified subset
of characters) within a physical area. Many surges
allow you to make these powerful attacks, as do a few
other abilities. When you make an area attack, follow
the above rules for attacking multiple characters, and
refer to the upcoming “Targeting and Range” section
to determine the effect’s area.

Creative Maneuvers

Adding variety to combat is fun, whether you’re disarm-
ing your foe or pinning their hand to the table. To keep
things simple, this game doesn’t provide separate rules
for a long list of combat maneuvers, but that doesn’t
mean they can’t be part of your story.
In general, if you want to execute a creative maneuver
with your weapon, that falls under the Strike action
(see “Actions and Reactions” earlier in this chapter).
When you Strike, describe how you want to attack;
if the GM agrees your maneuver is possible, they’ll
choose a defense for you to target (and potentially add
one or more disadvantages, depending on how complex
your maneuver is). If this attack test succeeds, the GM
determines any narrative or mechanical effects of your
maneuver (in addition to the normal damage dealt).

```
Effect Range
Many abilities limit how far away you can apply their
effects. All attacks are restricted to a certain range,
as are most other tests and effects.
```

```
Range
Some abilities allow you to apply effects from a distance.
These effects state a specific range —the farthest that
effect can reach from its origin (which is usually you).
Most abilities with range restrictions provide the range
in that ability’s text. However, the range of weapon
attacks depends on the weapon you use.
Long and Short Range
All ranged and thrown weapons, as well as some
abilities, specify both a short range and a long range
(usually expressed in feet and separated by a slash).
Tests within the short range are made as usual,
but tests in the long range gain a disadvantage.
For example, an axe with a range of [20/60] has a
short range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. You
can’t use that axe to attack characters more than 60 feet
away from you, and if you attack a character more than
20 feet away from you, the test gains a disadvantage.
Reach
Some abilities—and all melee attacks—require your
target to be within reach ; this applies whether you’re
reaching them using arms, claws, other appendages,
weapons, or surges. This special range includes
anywhere that’s both in your line of effect and within
5 feet of your space (see “Size and Space” later in this
chapter). Some weapons and effects can increase your
reach beyond 5 feet, but no matter the distance, you
must still have line of effect.
```

```
Area Effects
Some surges and other abilities can affect any character
(or a specified subset of character) in a large physical
area. Such area effects specify that physical area’s
size, usually in feet. This is often expressed as a square
(“each character in a 10-foot square”) or as a distance
from an origin point (“each character within 5 feet of the
fabrial”). However, these are abstractions for simplicity;
areas typically don’t need to be a perfect square or circle,
and the GM is free to describe the effect and make
exceptions in ways that make sense for that ability.
Within reason, each character whose space roughly
overlaps with an area effect is affected. For example, even
though a 10-foot square is technically two-dimensional,
a character standing on a stool above ground level usually
experiences the same area effect as a character sitting on
the ground, as long as it fits the story.
```

```
Targeting Characters
and Objects
At the GM’s discretion, some abilities can be used
regardless of your target’s location or whether you can
sense each other. Such abilities are often used to gather
or share information (for example, making an Insight
test while reading a letter, or making a Persuasion test
while writing one).
However, if you want to directly apply a mechanical
effect to a character or object (for example, restoring
health, applying a condition, or otherwise altering their
statistics), the following restrictions apply. As always,
it’s up to the GM to decide what best fits the narrative;
they might allow you to target something the rules don’t
officially allow, or they might decide that in the current
situation, you can’t reasonably affect a target regardless
of the rules.
```

```
Line of Effect
Many abilities can’t be used if there are obstructions
between you and your target. When an ability says you
need a line of effect to your target, you can only target
that character or object if an imaginary straight line
could directly connect any part of your body to any part
of the target without touching a solid object or passing
through an unreasonably small opening (such as a crack
in the door; this size is up to the GM’s discretion).
Locating and Sensing Targets
Unless an effect otherwise specifies, you can only target
a specific character or object if you know they’re in a
certain location within range.
If you believe you know where a target is but you
can’t sense them to confirm, you gain a disadvantage on
attacks and other tests targeting them that affect their
physical body. Attack tests made in this way can’t graze.
You can only test in this way if you’re aware of the
target’s existence and potential location through other
means (such as peering into Shadesmar or being told
of their position).
```

```
Influencing a Target
Some effects require you to be able to influence your
target. To do so, your target must be within a reasonable
communication distance, be able to sense you, and be
able to interpret the intent of your gestures, vocaliza-
tions, or similar communication. Unless otherwise
specified, you don’t need to share a language, as you
can make your intent clear through pointing command-
ingly, gesturing rudely, shouting encouragingly, and
so on. See “Who Can You Influence?” and “Resisting
Influence” in chapter 11 for more details.
```

**308** Chapter 10: Combat

Placing Area Effects
When an ability allows you to choose an effect’s area,
you can place that area anywhere one of its edges
touches the maximum range of the effect. For example,
if an effect targets “a 10-foot square within your reach,”
the entire 10-foot square doesn’t need to be within your
reach, as long as you can touch one corner of it.

Area Effects and Senses
Because area effects create a phenomenon in a physical
area regardless of who is in it, you can use them even
if you can’t sense any characters or objects within
the area. (This is different from effects where you
choose a specific character or characters; such effects
typically require you to sense the target or at least
know they exist.)

Area Effects and Barriers
Most area effects can’t penetrate solid obstacles like
walls, but it’s up to the GM to decide whether an
effect could reasonably extend past an obstacle or
curve around a corner. For example, the Division
surge’s Gout of Flame might be blocked by a sturdy
wall, but the Cohesion surge’s Sinkhole could suck
in targets on both sides of that wall.

Target Types

Talents and other abilities often specify who or what you
can target with an effect. Each **target** usually falls into
one of the following categories (though as always, the
GM makes the final determination):

**Character.** Most effects in this game target characters.
This term encompasses player characters, NPCs,
animals, and other entities that have statistics
and some level of animation, consciousness, or
independence. You are a character, so if a rule allows
you to target “a character,” you can target yourself.
(At the GM’s discretion, you might be able to
creatively use an effect that usually targets characters
to instead target an object or area. It’s always up to
the GM to decide how such effects work.)
**Object.** As a rule of thumb, if something isn’t a character
but it could reasonably be picked up or moved around,
it probably counts as an object. A rock is definitely an
object—but the mountain it came from probably isn’t.
**Enemy.** An enemy is a character who is currently
inclined to oppose your plans, resist your tests,
attack you, act in a hostile manner, or otherwise be
unenthused about your existence in the world.
**Ally.** Allies needn’t be directly aligned with you, but they
generally consider you with neutrality or friendliness.
They’re willing to help you or leave you to your own
devices, and they won’t interfere with you if you don’t

```
interfere with them. When you make a test against an
ally’s defenses, at the GM’s discretion, that ally can
choose for your test to automatically succeed. Note:
you are not considered your ally.
You. This book is written primarily in second person,
so it uses “you” a lot—but you still need access to
the corresponding talent or other effect for that rule
to count for you. “You” more specifically means “the
intended audience for this rule, as expressed earlier
in this section.”
Target. When used as a noun, a target is a general term
referring to anyone or anything you can apply an effect
to, including characters and objects. Many rules in this
book tell you to choose a “target” without specifying
if that’s a character or object. If unspecified, you can
apply the effect to either (within reason). However,
most rules assume you’ll be targeting a character,
so the effects might include things that objects can’t
do (like become Restrained). Ignore or modify any
irrelevant effects when targeting objects.
Other Types. Some effects specify other targets that
aren’t defined in the rules; these are generally com-
mon-sense situations meant for flexibility. For example,
some surges let you target a surface—this lets you affect
many areas based on what makes sense in the story,
rather than getting bogged down in a precise definition.
```

###### Movement and Positioning

```
Battlefields rarely offer flat, open terrain. Instead, you’ll
often find yourself doing all sorts of climbing, jumping,
or other stunts to get around the space. When you use
the Move or Disengage action (or any other ability that
moves you around the battlefield), keep these guide-
lines in mind.
```

```
Size and Space
Each character can control a different amount of space
in combat, depending on their size. A chasmfiend
towering over the battlefield has a much wider reach
than a lone soldier wielding a spear.
Character Size
All characters in this game are classified into five size
categories. A character’s size doesn’t directly reflect their
physical measurements, but rather, the amount of space
that they control in combat. (For example, if an effect
targets creatures “of your size or smaller,” this includes
creatures who are bulkier than you but still in your size
categor y.)
Imagine a character controlling a three-dimensional
area that’s shaped roughly like a cube; the approximate
size of that area determines a character’s size, as shown
```

```
Chapter 10: Combat 309
```

```
in the Character Sizes table. (The GM has discretion
over the exact shape and dimensions of each character’s
area; this needn’t be a cube, depending on the nature of
the character or effect.)
```

```
Character Sizes
Character Size Area Controlled
Small 2.5 feet
Medium 5 feet
Large 10 feet
Huge 15 feet
Gargantuan 20+ feet
(GM discretion)
```

```
Space
Each character fills a space the same as their size
category. Their space isn’t necessarily the exact area
their body fills—it represents the area they can easily
affect and move around in.
Unless otherwise specified, only one character can
occupy a space at a time (though you can move through
the space of willing creatures, as described in “Moving
Around Others”). This limits how many characters can
move next to another object or character. If enough
Large characters crowd around a Small one, there
won’t be room for anyone else to fit.
Squeezing Through Small Areas
Because you don’t actually take up the entire area in
your space, you can squeeze into a space one size
smaller than you. However, while squeezing in this way,
you are Slowed and attacks made against you gain an
advantage (because you can’t move around to avoid
the danger).
```

```
Movement Types
The Move action and other movement abilities
generally use your movement rate (see “Speed” in
chapter 3). However, if you want to fly, you’ll need a
separate flying rate (granted by effects such as the
Gravitation surge).
```

```
Standard Movement
When you use the Move action or similarly move, you’re
generally assumed to be walking or similarly propelling
yourself across the ground, bound by the laws of gravity.
However, you can flavor this movement any way you
wish—running, wheeling, skipping—as long as you
follow the rules of the game.
The following rules apply to more challenging ways
you might move using your movement rate.
```

```
Climbing, Crawling, and Swimming
When climbing, crawling, or swimming, you are Slowed
for that portion of your move. If a climb or swim is
extremely difficult (such as from a slippery surface or
rough waters), you may need to succeed on an Athletics
test to make progress.
Jumping
If part of your movement requires you to jump over a
gap or up into the air, you generally don’t need to make
a test to jump a horizontal distance equal to your size,
or a vertical distance equal to half your size. For longer
jumps, see “Athletics” in chapter 3.
Sneaking
When you’re sneaking (see “Stealth” in chapter 3), you
are Slowed. Additionally, you must stay out of your
opponent’s line of effect or risk being spotted.
```

```
Flying
When you use the Move action or otherwise move
while you have a flying rate, you can choose to either
use your normal movement rate (thus moving along the
ground) or your flying rate (thus moving through the
air), not both.
While flying, you pass above the battlefield, so you
don’t have to worry about passing through the spaces
of characters or terrain beneath you. However, you still
must navigate around characters and terrain in the
air with you.
Using bows and other ranged weapons is difficult
while flying. All ranged attacks gain a disadvantage due
to your unstable footing (see “Ranged Attacks” earlier
in this chapter).
If knocked Prone, you fall and potentially take
damage (see “Falling” below).
```

```
Moving Around Others
You can move through the area occupied by a willing
character. It’s assumed the two of you can navigate that
space and stay out of each other’s way. However, you
can’t move through the space occupied by an unwilling
character, unless otherwise allowed by an effect.
Either way, you can’t end any movement in the same
space as another character, whether friend or foe.
```

```
Forced Movement
Some actions or abilities can force characters to move,
such as by pushing or pulling them. Forced movement
isn’t affected by that character’s movement rate (or by
anything that affects that rate). Additionally, forced
movement doesn’t trigger the Reactive Strike reaction
or other abilities that trigger when a character leaves
your reach.
```

**310** Chapter 10: Combat

```
Falling
When you fall from a height of at least 10 feet, you
take damage when you collide with a surface below
you. After you land, take 1d6 impact damage for every
10 feet you fell.
If you take any damage from a fall, you are Prone
when you land.
```

```
Terrain
Certain terrain on the battlefield can affect combatants.
```

```
Cover
You can use nearby obstacles as cover if they block
an enemy’s line of effect to you, or if they otherwise
could reasonably block weapons, protect against
projectiles, or make you harder to perceive. When
within 5 feet of cover, you can use the Brace action
to add a disadvantage to most incoming attacks.
Difficult Terrain
Difficult terrain requires scrambling, slogging, or
is otherwise difficult to move through. You are Slowed
while moving through difficult terrain.
```

```
Dangerous Terrain
Dangerous terrain causes physical harm, such as
walking over embers or spikes. When you move into
or start your turn in dangerous terrain, you take the
damage specified by that terrain. If terrain doesn’t
specify the damage, the GM can use the Dangerous
Terrain table for inspiration.
```

```
Dangerous Terrain
Example Terrain Damage
Wooden spikes 1d4 keen
Blazing fire 1d8 energy
Highstorm winds 1d12 impact
```

###### Variant: Using a Grid

```
In many combats, you can rely on the GM’s descriptions
of the environment and combatants, using the theater of
your mind to imagine how the action unfolds. However,
for more complex fights, some groups find that visual
aids help them to keep track of the action and keep
everyone on the same page.
In these cases, the GM commonly uses a set of
miniatures to represent characters and a square grid
to track distances and positioning. When playing in
person, GMs often draw on large, erasable vinyl maps
(available online or at your local hobby store). Terrain
and obstacles can be drawn on the grid or represented
by three-dimensional terrain. When playing online,
```

```
GMs often use a virtual tabletop to display the terrain
and character tokens.
If you’re using a square grid to represent your
combat, the following sections provide guidance on
adapting this book’s rules to work with a grid.
```

```
Tactical Grid
Most groups use a grid of 1-inch squares. This size
works with the Stormlight miniatures as well as most
commercially available roleplaying miniatures.
On this size of grid, each side of a square represents
5 feet. Most sizes, distances, and ranges in this game
are divisible by 5, making them translate easily to this
size. For example, a Medium character or effect fills a
single 5-foot square. (If your group regularly uses a grid,
you may wish to divide your movement rate and ranges
by 5 to translate them into the corresponding number
of squares, then note those numbers on your character
sheet for easy reference.)
Some groups prefer to use a hexagonal grid; these
work much like a square grid but allow more realistic
and flexible movement.
```

```
Chapter 10: Combat 311
```

PETAR PENEV

Movement

When moving your character, you move from
square to square (or hexagon to hexagon) on the
grid. Each new square represents you moving
5 feet. Regardless of whether you move horizontally,
vertically, or diagonally, it costs the same 5 feet of
movement. (While the diagonal is technically longer,
this rule dramatically simplifies movement during play.)
To enter a square, you must have at least 5 or more
feet of movement remaining (or 10 or more if you
are Slowed).

Corners
You can’t move diagonally if you’d cross a corner that’s
obstructed by an enemy, wall, or other terrain feature
that blocks the square.

Range and Line of Effect

To determine your range or distance to other combat-
ants, count the shortest route from you to the object as
if you were moving there. If making a ranged attack,
ignore obstacles that your projectile can reason-
ably fly over.
To determine whether another square is in your line
of effect (see the earlier “Targeting and Range” section),
draw an imaginary line from a corner of your square

```
to any corner of that square. If you can draw that line
without passing through or touching a solid object,
that square is in your line of effect.
```

```
Sizes and Areas of Effect
Each character’s space (see the earlier “Size and Space”
section) fills a square or squares based on their size.
If a miniature you’re using doesn’t quite match up to
those dimensions, that’s okay—for simplicity, just use
the footprint of the miniature to determine how many
squares it takes up on the battlefield. However, use the
character’s in-game size for calculating all other rules.
When determining areas of effect, their dimensions
are outlined in increments of 5 feet, aligning to the
lines of the grid. When determining an effect’s point of
origin, you can start the effect in any space adjacent to a
space you occupy (the area doesn’t need to include your
space). For example, if you target a large area with the
Division surge, only one square of that area needs to be
next to your square; the rest can extend much farther
away from you.
If an effect only impacts a Small (2.5-foot diameter)
area, it generally still affects one entire 5-foot square
since that is the grid’s smallest increment—but the GM
might take some creative liberties with resolving the
outcome when it suits the narrative.

###### Opportunities and

###### Complications in Combat

Some talents and enemy profiles suggest uses for
Opportunities and Complications (see “Plot Die” in this
book’s introduction), but some of the best stories come
from creative interpretations of these plot die outcomes.
Use your environment and the strengths and weaknesses
of your enemies to create memorable and fun effects!
While defeating your enemies is usually a primary
goal of combat, you’re often trying to accomplish
something else (such as escaping, protecting others,
or grabbing a key item). Think about ways you can use
Opportunities and Complications to advance (or hinder)
your other goals in the scene. Sure, you’re attacking an
opponent, but why?
The Combat Opportunities and Complications table
provides inspiration for potential outcomes.

**Combat Opportunities and Complications**

```
Opportunity Complication
Friendly reinforcements arrive. Enemy reinforcements arrive.
A wounded enemy decides to
flee or otherwise surrender.
```

```
You accidentally finish off
an enemy you were trying
to leave alive for questioning.
You get a bit of extra time to
achieve your goal.
```

```
You lose time and your goal
becomes more urgent.
```

###### Mounted Combat

```
If you wish, you can ride a mount in combat. To ride a
mount, the mount must be larger than you and logically
capable of carrying you. The GM is the final arbiter of
what you can use as a mount.
```

```
Riding Mounts
To safely mount or dismount, you must use.
While riding a mount, you occupy the same space
as the mount, and when you move on your turn, you
use their movement rate instead of your own.
Under normal conditions, you don’t need to
make a skill test to move the mount. For difficult
maneuvers, the GM might call for a Survival test to
steer your mount, raising the stakes if the mount is
resisting. The GM can spend C from this test—or
from other tests you make while riding—to make you
fall from the mount and land Prone on the ground.
Using Mount Abilities
If you have a utility expertise in riding your particular
mount (such as an expertise in Riding Horses), you can
activate abilities from their profile by spending your own
resources (including focus, , and ). These abilities
happen on your turn, not on a separate turn for the
mount. If you don’t have expertise in riding that mount,
they take no actions of their own.
```

```
Attacking Mounts
You can target a mount or rider with attacks and other
abilities—but so can your enemies! For example, if
you trigger a Reactive Strike while riding a mount,
the enemy might choose to attack your mount
instead of you.
If you make a melee attack against a rider whose
mount is bigger than you, you gain a disadvantage on
the attack unless you’re also riding a mount of that size
or larger.

## CORE RULEBOOK VERSION CORE RULEBOOK VERSION

# TT

```
hough Roshar is a world defined by war,
politics and intrigue have played an equally
important role in shaping its history. The
pursuit of your goals will require not only the clashing
of swords, but the exchanging of words.
Conversations encapsulate social scenes where
at least two characters are talking and attempting
to achieve their goals through dialogue, such as by
negotiating, deceiving, interrogating, or establishing
personal connections.
Many conversations can become adversarial.
When you attempt to convince, intimidate, lie to, or
otherwise influence someone, you might need a skill test
to succeed. Even then, particularly confident or stubborn
characters might resist your attempts to influence them,
and you’ll have to strategically wear them down to get
what you want out of the conversation.
```

###### Setting the Scene

```
Any type of scene, including a combat or endeavor, can
transition into a conversation when it fits the story. This
doesn’t require the GM to officially announce “you’re in
a conversation now,” but setting the scene lets you know
who you’re engaging with and what to expect.
At the start of a conversation or whenever goals or
participants change significantly, the GM should briefly
describe who you’re talking to, then ask what you want
to achieve. Based on your expressed objectives, the GM
will give you a sense of who needs to be persuaded—
and of what.
```

```
Consider Objectives
Social interaction is complex and nuanced, so it’s not
always clear what people want or what tactics may
appeal to them. It can help the flow of a scene for the
GM to provide clear objectives, but there isn’t a right
or wrong way to go about achieving these objectives,
```

**chapter** 11

## Conversations

```
so the GM can’t give you a checklist of what to do.
However, they should provide helpful context on the
other participants’ motives, needs, and desires (or at
least, those you would be aware of ). This allows you
to make relevant contributions to the conversation.
```

###### Order of Conversations

```
Conversations in the game unfold much like those
in real life, as characters pontificate, interject, argue,
and talk over each other. To reflect this free-form
interaction, conversations have significantly less
structure than combat, and time isn’t tracked as
concretely. However, certain rules help the GM
adjudicate the flow of the conversation and determine
how your attempts go over with NPCs in the scene.
```

```
Flexible Rounds
While you’ll find yourself in many conversations that
are less than polite, it’s important that out of character,
everyone still has fun and feels involved. Characters
generally contribute one at a time (see “Contributions”),
and everyone in the scene should have a chance to
participate. When everyone has had a chance to
contribute (if they want to), this counts as one “round”
of the conversation. This isn’t as structured as a round
of combat, but it helps with timing your abilities and
other game effects.
```

```
When to Use Conversations
Sometimes you might persuade someone to agree
to a proposed plan with a single test, in which case a
conversation scene isn’t needed. However, conversations
are especially helpful in situations like the following:
```

◆ (^) Two or more groups are trying to reach a compromise
that requires both to give something up.
◆ (^) Belligerent factions are negotiating.
◆ (^) Multiple people need convincing.

against their own interests or ideals.

```
It’s a good idea for the GM to check back in with
each player if their character hasn’t weighed in recently.
If a character’s last contribution was to lean stoically
against the back wall while others do the talking, the
group should check if that’s what the player wants to
continue doing.
```

```
Contributions
As you, your fellow players, and the GM play out your
interactions, you can communicate either using your
character’s voice or describing your actions in the third
person. Either way, each time you meaningfully influ-
ence the conversation, you’re making a contribution.
For example, you might shift the conversation’s focus,
sway participants one way or another, support an ally, or
gain more insight into the situation. These contributions
aren’t intended as rules to limit the scene, but to provide
as much support for roleplay as your group finds helpful.
Contribution Outcomes
How a given contribution is resolved depends on what
you’re attempting to accomplish. Some contributions
just include a wry quip or flavorful interjection, while
others have a significant impact on the conversation
(and might require a skill test to resolve).
```

```
Most contributions work toward one of these
five outcomes:
Influence a Person. Many contributions attempt
to influence another person through lies, logic,
intimidation, or other means; after all, exerting
influence is the goal of most conversations. To change
a character’s opinion or behavior, you’ll generally
make a skill test with a DC equal to their Spiritual
or Cognitive defense (depending on the skill used).
Depending on the circumstances, the GM might
increase or decrease that DC, and you might gain an
advantage or disadvantage based on your approach.
Even on a successful test, the other person might
temporarily resist your influence by spending focus
(see “Focus in Conversations” below).
Help or Hinder Efforts. Conversation can be a
group effort, so you might help by augmenting an
ally’s arguments or undercutting an opponent’s
position. This contribution usually grants your ally
an advantage—or your opponent a disadvantage—
on their next test in the conversation.
Bolster an Ally. You can encourage, reassure, or
otherwise bolster another person in the conversation.
This usually results in your target recovering a bit of
```

**316** Chapter 11: Conversations

```
ROMAIN KURDI
```

focus (as determined by the GM). This is a valuable
boon, as focus represents each person’s resolve
and patience for the conversation (see “Focus in
Conversations” below).
**Gather Information.** You can scrutinize another person
or the environment. Depending on difficulty, the GM
might ask you to make a skill test against your target’s
Spiritual or Cognitive defense (depending on the skill
used), or they might simply give you the information
you sought.
**Interject Flavor.** You can always interject to add flavor
or context to a conversation. These contributions have
no rules—they’re just part of the fun of roleplaying.

When to Test
If the outcome of your contribution is uncertain, or if it
hinges on your skill, the GM will ask you to make a test
(typically against the opponent’s defense in the same
category as the skill). Nearly any skill could be used in
a conversation at the GM’s discretion. Here are some
examples of contributions that might require a test:

**Persuasion.** Using raw charm to convince someone to
act against their better judgment.
**Deception.** Lying to convince someone of an
untrue premise.
**Intimidation.** Browbeating someone to weaken
their position.
**Leadership.** Inspiring someone to follow their
better nature.
**Perception.** Observing someone to notice whether they
take any suspicious actions.
**Insight.** Using empathy to understand someone
else’s position.
**Deduction.** Thinking through an opponent’s argument
logically to find flaws.

The Conversation Opportunities and Complications
table provides inspiration for tests that result in
either of those.

**Conversation
Opportunities and Complications**

```
Opportunity Complication
You remember a helpful and
relevant fact.
```

```
Something you thought you
knew turns out to be a lie.
An observer is impressed
with you.
```

```
An observer is scornful of you.
```

```
Your Radiant spren makes a
helpful observation.
```

```
Your Radiant spren gets
distracted by something.
You distract others from
noticing the intentions behind
your actions.
```

```
You draw unwanted attention to
yourself in the conversation.
```

```
Using Abilities in Conversations
While some talents, actions, and other abilities are
focused on combat, you might find creative ways to
use them for a contribution. Some abilities provide
guidance for using them outside of combat (for
example, see “Surge Infusions and Durations” in
chapter 6), while others are left to your creativity.
It’s always up to the GM whether you can use an
ability to contribute, and how.
```

###### Focus in Conversations

```
Your focus represents your mental wherewithal,
concentration, and patience, making it very important
during conversations. Until you run out of focus, you
can use it to avoid being influenced by other characters
and to fuel special abilities granted to you by talents.
```

```
Who Can You Influence?
To influence someone, you must be able to communicate
with them, which generally requires them to sense you
or otherwise receive information from you. Sometimes,
influencing someone requires complex arguments,
while other times, a look or gesture is enough to get the
point across.
If an ability affects a character you “can influence,”
it refers to any character who you can communicate
with in an appropriately effective manner.
```

```
Resisting Influence
Both NPCs and PCs tend to have a strong idea of who
they are, and of what they will or won’t do. So when
you attempt to influence someone in a conversation,
it’s unlikely you can change their mind with a single
skill test.
When a character succeeds on a socially oriented skill
test against an opponent (or otherwise does something
very persuasive), their opponent can choose to spend
focus to resist influence. The amount of focus
spent depends on how persuasive the GM decides the
contribution is. If reasonably persuasive, an opponent
must spend 2 focus to remain resolute. If an argument
is extremely strong, the opponent must spend
4 focus instead.
If the GM decides that a particular argument is
incredibly persuasive or hits on a topic an NPC is
unlikely to resist, the NPC might choose to not resist
at all. Otherwise, once the NPC runs out of focus,
they generally concede the point or become open to
a compromise (see “Running Out of Focus”).
```

```
Chapter 11: Conversations 317
```

```
Even when you’re completely out of focus, this never
forces your character to do or believe something you
disagree with. You can have your character change their
mind if you wish, but it’s up to you to decide what the
effects are and how this impacts the story.
```

###### Conversation Types

```
Conversations can take many forms based on the
goals of the participants. This section suggests tips for
running a few types of conversations, but conversations
can shift fluidly between these (and many other) types
as the goals develop and the scene unfolds. After each
conversation type, a table presents inspiration for
Opportunities and Complications that might emerge
from such a conversation.
```

```
Inquiry
In an Inquiry , one or more parties are trying to acquire
relevant information. Inquiries range from casual
fact-finding conversations to formal interviews to tense
examinations. This typically takes the form of one
party trying to acquire information while another tries
to withhold or obscure it, but there could be multiple
inquiring parties with varied motives, such as in a legal
proceeding.
At the outset of an Inquiry, the GM and players
should discuss what information the players seek, and
the GM should consider what involved NPCs may
wish to learn.
If it comes to light that the information can be had
for a price, an Inquiry might become a Negotiation.
```

```
Inquiry Opportunities and Complications
Opportunity Complication
Through your questioning, you
learn you share an objective
(or enemy) with the person
you’re questioning.
```

```
You accidentally reveal more
than intended to the person
you’re questioning—or you can
spend 2 focus to resist.
Your demeanor sets the person
you’re questioning at ease.
You gain an advantage on your
next test against them.
```

```
You offend the person you’re
questioning, making further
questions difficult. You gain a
disadvantage on your next test
against them.
A distraction in the environ-
ment leaves the other party
in disarray.
```

```
Someone enters the scene with
an unrelated request for the
other party.
```

```
Resisting Mechanical Effects
Any effect targeting a “character you can influence” can
be resisted by that character (unless otherwise stated).
If an effect doesn’t require the target to be influenceable,
they generally can’t resist it; however, some effects (like
the Scholar’s Keen Insight talent) state that a target can
resist the influence of that effect, even it isn’t an attempt
to persuade the target. These effects can also be resisted
by spending 2 focus, as if the effect were a socially
oriented skill test.
```

```
Player Characters and Influence
In conversations, your opponents are usually the ones
resisting influence, not you. Depending on how the
conversation goes, the GM might ask you to resist
influence at some point—but the way you roleplay these
situations is up to you, and you’re never forced to choose
between spending focus and making your character
believe or do something that doesn’t fit their story.
```

```
Running Out of Focus
An NPC’s focus can be an effective timer or gauge for
your progress in a conversation. While a pliable target
like a town guard might give into your party’s persuasion
quickly, a strong-willed NPC requires more convincing.
For these characters, the GM can have them spend
focus to resist the PCs’ influence, requiring the group to
wear down the NPC with a few successful attempts.
When an NPC is reduced to 0 focus (often because
of resisting influence), they become too frustrated,
scattered, or distracted to effectively contribute to a
conversation. They can no longer resist being influenced
and might check out of the conversation entirely.
Some resistant characters might need to be worn
down before they can be convinced. However, failures,
Complications, misspoken words, or the pressure of
time could result in the conversation ending before
you can get your way. Sometimes it’s better to take a
different approach.
Player Characters With No Focus
If you start running low on focus (and thus narratively
become more vulnerable to outside influence), you might
decide you want to step away from the conversation—
or you might consider a cue to roleplay a different
tactic, based on how you think your character would
react. A hothead might decide to start a fight, while
a more reserved character might decide to give up on
conversation and find more accommodating characters
to talk to or seek other ways to pursue their goal.

Negotiation

In a **Negotiation** , two or more interested groups
are attempting to get something from each other,
generally while expending as few resources as possible.
Negotiations are a strange amalgam of competition
and cooperation, with each side trying to levy every
advantage at its disposal. However, for both sides to
profit, there must be give and take, or one side might
simply walk away.
At the outset of a Negotiation, the GM and players
should discuss what the players wish to attain, and the
GM should consider what that might cost. If the PCs

```
seek a material good or service, a price may be available
in chapter 7. If they want something that’s more
abstract, the price might be harder to quantify, but the
GM should still start by deciding what the other party’s
opening price is (such as a political favor, strategic
alliance, or commitment to some cause).
If one party stops dealing in good faith (or it’s
revealed that they never intended to uphold their end
of the bargain), a Negotiation might become a Scheme.
```

```
Negotiation Opportunities and Complications
Opportunity Complication
You notice a subtle clue about
the resources the other party
truly has available.
```

```
You tip your hand about the
exact resources you possess at
the moment—or you can spend
2 focus to resist.
You remember a custom or law
that could play in your favor in
the negotiation.
```

```
The opposing party reveals a
barrier to making a deal, and it’s
out of their control.
The person you’re dealing
with inadvertently reveals that
someone else could provide you
what you need.
```

```
Another bidder enters the
scene, which threatens to raise
the price unless you can drive
them off.
```

```
Scheme
In a Scheme , at least one party is trying to dupe
another person or organization. This could be a con job
to steal material wealth, an intrigue to learn key political
secrets, or a plot to spread a useful rumor that sets up
future machinations. Usually, the targeted party—often
known as the mark—believes they’re in a different
type of conversation, as a Scheme becomes much less
successful once it’s recognized as such. If the deceivers
succeed, the mark might not realize they were duped
until long after the conversation ends.
If the PCs are scheming against an NPC, the GM
should ask at the outset how the PCs are presenting
the Scheme (what’s their cover story?), as well as their
eventual goal. The GM should also ask the players
what steps their characters are taking to make the false
premises seem plausible, and have them make tests for
these preparations accordingly.
```

```
Chapter 11: Conversations 319
```

```
Social
During a Social conversation, characters seek to form
bonds, impress potential allies, and generally build
interpersonal connections. Socializing is generally
earnest, though that doesn’t mean that all participants
must be wholly truthful. Characters may be pursuing
hidden agendas, and rival NPCs may be working to
undermine the PCs’ efforts.
At the outset of a Social scene, the GM should
ask the players if their characters have any specific
goals and encourage them to pursue these narratively.
Similarly, the GM should consider the narrative goals
of the NPCs, so they can proactively pursue these goals
during lulls in the conversation.
If one or more groups decide to pursue agendas,
socializing can shift into any other conversation type
as the GM and players see fit.
```

```
Socializing Opportunities and Complications
Opportunity Complication
You notice a subtle hint of
someone’s hidden emotional
state.
```

```
You accidentally make
a small cultural blunder
or say something that’s
contextually gauche.
You take the opportunity to
truly relax, recovering 1d4
focus.
```

```
You become aggravated or
drained by the conversation,
losing 1 focus.
You impress the person you’re
talking to, making them inclined
to help you in the future.
```

```
You spot an opportunity to
pursue one of your goals, but in
a way that would disrupt your
current conversation.
```

If a Scheme is ever unveiled to all parties, the
conversation likely ends. The ultimate outcome
depends on the circumstances—combat might
ensue, or the would-be marks might simply leave.

**Scheme Opportunities and Complications**

```
Opportunity Complication
Your mark unknowingly reveals
information about themself,
giving details you can later use
to corroborate your story.

One of your lies unravels due

###### Example Conversation

```
This example of gameplay illustrates the flow of a
conversation. Lisiril, Jhesh, and Aj have been searching
for a buyer for the strange ancient fabrial they found in
the ruins—but now they’ve run into a stumbling block.
Game Master (GM): Jorni the merchant looks the
item over, then she places it on the table. “You’re
looking to sell, eh?” We’ll handle this conversation
as a Negotiation. What do you want to get for it?
Rico (playing Aj): 5,000 marks!
Taylor (playing Jhesh): We don’t even know what
it does. I flubbed the roll to inspect it earlier.
Rico (playing Aj): So you’re saying it could do
anything! Who can put a price on possibility?
GM: If you start talking like that in character, this
will become a Scheme. But let’s proceed with a
Negotiation for now.
Mia (playing Lisiril): I open by saying, “We’ve found
this treasure and want to sell it. We could sell it to
Krub in the next warcamp over, but we’d rather sell
it to our good friend ... uh...”
GM: Jorni.
Mia (playing Lisiril): “Right, Jorni. Our good friend.
We’re asking 1,000 marks.”
GM: Okay, go ahead and make a Persuasion test to
influence Jorni. Because you’ve never actually met
Jorni before, raise the stakes.
```

_Mia rolls a d20 along with the plot die, rolling a 12 on the
d20 with a_ **2** _on the plot die. She adds her Persuasion
modifier of +4, along with the +2 from the plot die, for a
total of 18. That’s higher than Jorni’s Spiritual defense,
which the GM set as the DC._
**GM:** Well, despite the slightly shady opening, you’re
pretty persuasive. Jorni seems interested despite her
skepticism.

_The GM notes to themself that Jorni spends 2 focus to resist
influence._
**GM:** However, that Complication means that you let on
a bit more than you intended. Mia, you can choose:
have Lisiril spend 2 focus to stay on topic, or have
Lisiril reveal something that’s useful to Jorni in the
Negotiation.
**Mia (playing Lisiril):** Hmm. Maybe Lisiril lets slip
that we were being chased through the ruin by that
Dustbringer?

```
GM: And the item might be dangerous to own or sell?
Sure, that works. Jorni looks over and says “Will I even
be able to sell this thing if dangerous people want it?
Maybe you should pay me a danger commission here.”
The GM rolls a d20 for Jorni and sets the DC as Lisiril’s
Spiritual defense, since Jorni is trying to persuade Lisiril.
Jorni rolls a 7 on the d20, then the GM adds Jorni’s
Persuasion modifier of +4, giving a total of 11. That’s
lower than Lisiril’s Spiritual defense (which the GM set
as the DC), so the GM doesn’t call for Lisiril to spend
focus to resist influence.
Rico (playing Aj): What are you doing behind
the screen there, GM? Anyway, Aj steps in to say
“There’s no way that guy could track us. Even if he
can slide on walls. When he isn’t disintegrating them.”
Taylor (playing Jhesh): “What Aj means to say is
that we didn’t have any trouble dealing with him.”
Jhesh tries to look both tough and sincere.
GM: More tough, or more sincere?
Taylor (playing Jhesh): Let’s say more tough.
GM: Okay, roll Intimidation. Raise the stakes for Aj’s
“helpful” addition.
Taylor (playing Jhesh): Thanks, Rico.
Rico (playing Aj): No problem!
Taylor rolls a d20 along with the plot die, rolling a 17
on the d20 with a 4 on the plot die. They add their
Intimidation modifier of +2, along with the +4 from
the plot die, for a total of 23. That’s higher than Jorni’s
Cognitive defense (which the GM set as the DC).
GM: Jorni drops the line of questioning. Clearly you’re
tough enough that it’s not worth the trouble.
The GM notes to themself that Jorni again spends 2 focus
to resist influence, reducing her focus to 0. Jorni won’t be
able to resist influence again, so the GM decides that she
throws in the towel now—and tries to convince the PCs to
do her a favor in exchange for the sale.
GM: Jorni nods. “Okay, I’m willing to take this thing
off your hands for 1,000 marks. Trouble is, I don’t
have the funds on hand.” That’s the Complication,
by the way. Jorni continues, “Now, if you could help
me with a bit of a bandit problem, I could get the
money. I’d even pay you a bit extra for your trouble...

## CORE RULEBOOK VERSION CORE RULEBOOK VERSION

**chapter** 12

## Endeavors

```
Due to this flexible timing and the sheer variety of
undertakings that endeavors can represent, they are
by far the most malleable type of scene. When your
group begins to pursue an objective that you want to
play out at the table but that isn’t a good fit for combat
or conversation scenes, the GM should typically set
the scene for an endeavor.
```

```
Define Objectives
and Circumstances
At the start of the endeavor, the GM should make it
clear what your objective is (or at least what you believe
your objective is), as well as the circumstances you’ll face
(such as the environment and obstacles). Your objective
is usually pretty clear based on what brought you to this
scene in the story; maybe your last opponent in a combat
fled and now you’re chasing them through the city
streets, or perhaps you set off into the Unclaimed Hills
to locate some lost ruins. In some cases where you’re
unaware of what brought your characters to a location,
the GM might have to detail your goal more explicitly.
```

```
Set Endeavor Threshold
Based on your objectives and the circumstances of the
endeavor, the GM determines whether they want to use
a collective threshold for the scene. If so, they choose
how many successes or failures are required before the
endeavor concludes (see “Collective Thresholds” and
“Setting the Threshold”). They usually don’t share
this information with you, and instead keep it in the
background to inform how the endeavor’s story unfolds.
```

```
Introduce Special Rules
Finally, the GM outlines any special rules that are
in effect for the endeavor. If this scene is using any
special mechanics, you should be aware of the basics
of how they work, allowing you to engage with and
use them smoothly.
```

# SS

```
neaking into an enemy highlord’s manor,
searching the winding streets of Yeddaw for an
elusive target, connecting the pieces of a tricky
investigation—these high-stakes scenes are important
to an adventure, but they unfold much differently than
a combat or a conversation. This chapter presents
guidance on running these endeavors , determining
how they unfold, and keeping them tense and fun.
As with everything in this book, you can approach
endeavors with as much structure or flexibility as you
wish, and possibly add new rules or variations that
emphasize the scene’s theme.
This chapter offers specific guidance for four types
of endeavor: Discovery, Exploration, Mission, and
Pursuit. However, the possibilities are endless; these
are merely a starting point to inspire GMs to customize
the roleplaying experience for their group.
```

###### Setting the Scene

```
At its core, an endeavor allows you to work toward a
defined goal while flexibly combining roleplay and skill
tests to determine the outcome and consequences of
whatever you’re trying to achieve. During endeavors,
time flows at whatever pace best fits the story. In one
moment, the GM might narrate a “zoomed-out”
montage of events that span several hours. In the next
moment, you might “zoom in” to focus on a tricky
puzzle or environmental hazard for your group to
enjoy playing out in real time.

Chapter 12: Endeavors 323
```

```
LEE SETIAWAN
```

```
Completing Endeavors
Depending on what your party is trying to accomplish,
the endeavor might result in a positive outcome that
meets your goal, or it might end more negatively. For
example, a chase usually ends with your quarry either
being caught or escaping. A murder investigation
might result in identifying a suspect or your case
might go cold.
Usually, your group collectively works toward the
endeavor’s objective. Each of your efforts contributes to
the overall success, while each failure risks pushing the
endeavor into failure. When working together in this
way, your GM can use a collective threshold.
```

```
Collective Thresholds
A collective threshold helps the GM track your
group’s progress. By giving a rough idea of the scene’s
pacing, it guides the GM in deciding when the narrative
should start working toward a conclusion.
When using a collective threshold, the GM first
decides how complex the endeavor should be (see
“Setting the Threshold”), then tracks the total number
of successful and failed skill tests made toward the
objective. This progress can be tracked out in the open,
but the GM usually keeps it secret and just uses it to
inform how they tell the story.
If your group reaches the needed number of
successes, you attain your goal, but if you collectively
fail too many times first, the endeavor resolves
unfavorably.
Flexible Thresholds
These thresholds aren’t a concrete rule, merely a
guide on when it might feel satisfying to complete the
endeavor. If you do something spectacular on your turn,
the GM might count it as two successes. Conversely,
if your group reaches the needed number of successes,
but the GM feels the objective isn’t quite met in the
narrative, they might secretly require another success
or two. (If extending an endeavor like this, the GM
should keep momentum by lowering upcoming DCs
and moving the story toward completion.)
If you find other creative solutions to the problem,
you might be able to bypass the collective threshold
altogether. It’s just a tool to help the GM track the
general progress of your group, but ultimately the
story takes precedent. If something spectacular or
horrible occurs that would end the endeavor right
there, the GM might decide to throw out the threshold
and resolve the endeavor in whatever way makes the
most sense for the story.
```

###### Order of Endeavors

```
Endeavors unfold following the general guidelines for
roleplaying (see “Roleplaying” in chapter 9): the GM
sets the scene, you decide what to do, the GM calls for
tests based on what you’re attempting, then they narrate
the results.
```

```
Flexible Rounds
Like in conversations, endeavors unfold in informal
“rounds.” During each round, every member of your
party can contribute to the group’s effort and discuss
what their character is doing. Once each member has
had a chance to take a “turn” and weigh in with what
they’re doing, a new round begins.
Time is malleable in endeavors, so the narrative
flow of the scene affects how much time each individual
round represents. Generally, this ebbs and flows with
the story. However, if you ever need details on timing
for one of your abilities, just ask the GM how much
time is passing during a given round.
Your group continues playing out rounds in this way
until you succeed or fail at your objective—or until
you get pulled into another combat, conversation, or
endeavor scene (see “Completing Endeavors” later in
this section).
```

```
Taking Your Turn
When you decide to take your “turn,” describe to the
GM what your character is doing and what abilities
you’re using. The GM decides how that action unfolds,
usually by having you make a test; but occasionally
(especially if you’re using powerful surges), they might
just narrate the outcomes of your actions without
requiring a test. Meanwhile, if you team up with and
help another character in their actions, the GM might
have you resolve your turns together.
On some turns, the GM might zoom in for more
detail on your actions. For example, your party might
be searching the city for a Ghostblood agent, and your
fellow characters are making tests to check with their
contacts or scout out known safehouses. Each of these
turns involves a single test to see how their attempts are
unfolding. Meanwhile, if your attempt to bribe a guard
bears some fruit, the GM might decide to play out a
quick conversation between you and the guard to resolve
that situation. It’s up to the GM and the needs of the
story to determine how much detail each turn gets.
```

**324** Chapter 12: Endeavors

**Setting the Threshold**
The GM sets each endeavor’s collective threshold by
thinking about the overall complexity of your group’s
objective and how likely success feels in the narrative.
The Collective Threshold Examples table provides
inspiration for collective thresholds (and suggests an
endeavor type for that scene), but your group should
do whatever fits your story.

Individual Thresholds
In endeavors where members of your group are working
on different objectives and tracking individual progress
would make more sense for the story, the GM can use
the collective threshold rules but track each character’s
successes and failures separately.

Interpreting Skill Tests
During an endeavor, GMs should encourage players
to use skills creatively. It’s obvious that a Discovery
endeavor benefits from Deduction and an Exploration
endeavor benefits from Survival, but every endeavor
should have options for characters to use their physical,
cognitive, and spiritual skills. The upcoming sections
give examples of skill tests that might be relevant in
different types of endeavors, but with enough creativity,
nearly any skill can fit.
Beyond skills, you can use other abilities to make
progress in an endeavor. Some abilities, such as surges,
generally don’t require a skill test but still make a
demonstrable contribution to your group’s progress.
In these cases, the GM may add a success to the
threshold without requiring any kind of test.

Determining Outcomes
While creating an endeavor, the GM should plan for
how the plot could proceed after the party succeeds or
fails. On a success, the party might bypass a subsequent
scene (or gain the upper hand when entering it). On
a failure, the characters might trigger a combat or
conversation (such as needing to fight guards after
failing a Mission to infiltrate the palace).

GM Tip: Endeavors and Failing Forward
Failing an endeavor should never stop the PCs in their
tracks. It’s okay—even good—for a party to experience
losses and setbacks, but they shouldn’t start feeling stuck.
When you set up an endeavor, plan both outcomes in
ways that move the story forward. Successes and failures
should each open different plotlines and affect how the
party enters the next scene.
For example, the party might’ve failed to catch a
Ghostblood agent, but they did grab the agent’s dropped
knife, and its interesting glyphpair might open a new
investigation. Or the party might’ve ruined the fabrial
before finishing their research on it, but the recovered
materials reveal a clue on where they might find more.
Especially when tests are failing, Opportunities are
a great way to seed in hints on how to move forward.
Complications can also shake up the plot in an interesting
way when paired with a failed endeavor. For example, the
PCs failed to rescue an abducted ardent in time—and
thanks to Complications, they become the main suspects
in the ardent’s disappearance. The party is then arrested
by guards investigating the matter, and the PCs have a
chance to convince the guards of their innocence. If the
PCs succeed, the guards may be willing to share their own
leads on the abduction and work together with the party.

```
then redirect them toward a different goal with a note
to revisit the Discovery as soon as possible.
When running the Discovery, the GM keeps track of
your progress through an investigative web, reminding
you of your current leads and clues at each round.
```

```
Investigative Web
Whether your group is trying to learn the intended
function of a fabrial recovered from a sunken ship or
solve the murder of a highprince, you’ll most likely start
with a few leads. The GM can build an investigative
web to structure the information given. This web is a
map of an investigation: it contains each clue that can
be found as part of the investigation, and the leads that
clue generates pointing to other clues. Eventually, one
or more of these clues should lead to the objective of
the endeavor—whatever the group is trying to discover.
See the “Discovery Examples” section later in this
section for a sample investigative web.
No Threshold for Success
The investigative web replaces the need for a collective
success threshold during a Discovery endeavor. Instead
of just tracking successes, the GM can keep track of
which clues have been found and where those lead.
```

###### Discovery Endeavors

In **Discovery** endeavors, characters investigate the
mysteries of magic, history, and current events. These
scenes highlight the unknown and open a way to find
answers. These endeavors don’t simply track the group’s
progress though a flat threshold. Instead, progress is
represented by an investigative web that links together
clues that can be discovered in an organic way, each
linking to even more clues that slowly lead toward
the truth.

Running a Discovery

Discovery endeavors provide structure for how an
investigation into a mystery might unfold. However,
this level of detail requires some preparation on the
GM’s part. These endeavors usually require around
ten to thirty minutes of preparation, so if the need for
an unplanned Discovery presents itself during a session,
the GM might decide to wait until the next game
session or after a break to begin one. In a situation
like this, the GM could offer a reason why the party
isn’t able to search for answers yet (a crime scene is
sealed until the authorities have conducted their own
investigation, an important witness isn’t available, etc.),

```
Resolution
Once the party has discovered the information they were
seeking or reaches a failure threshold, the Discovery
ends. If it fails, the outcome depends on the stakes in
the story; maybe a competing investigator gets to the
information first, enemy soldiers catch up with the
party, or desired information becomes inaccessible.
```

```
Special Rule:
Betting on a Hunch
Even if a group fails a Discovery by reaching the allotted
number of failures, they may learn enough from a few
clues to make an educated guess. To bet on a hunch, the
characters band together to come up with a guess for the
Discovery. If their guess is correct, treat the Discovery
as if the characters had succeeded. If their guess is
incorrect, use the situation’s ambiguity to introduce
new twists in the story. Characters (and their players)
may assume their conclusion is valid as they move on to
another scene—but if they’re wrong, they’ll suffer the
eventual consequences of betting on their hunch.
```

Examples table presents inspiration for how characters
might accomplish some tasks, along with an example of
Opportunities and Complications.
```

busy marketplace.
```

```
Plot Die Outcome
Opportunity Exonerate a wrongly accused suspect, earning
their loyalty.
Complication Tip off a suspect, giving them the chance to
escape and thus closing a lead line.
```

```
The endeavor then ends when the group finds their
way to their objective through the web. Instead of being
pursued linearly, the endeavor is explored in a branching
web of options.
Depending on the story, the GM may want to
still track failures. This results in a failed endeavor
if your group reaches the threshold of failures before
uncovering the answers.
Leads
At the start of a Discovery, the GM provides the PCs
with several leads , usually two to four. These are
either details shared by an NPC or bits of information
the party has learned on their own. Leads function
as gateways that each continue with a line of clues,
otherwise known as a lead line. The characters begin
taking turns, each making a relevant test at the GM’s
prompting, in the hopes of uncovering another clue in
the line or beginning another lead line.
```

```
Clues
Every clue has the potential to uncover the next in a
lead line, until the final piece of information is obtained.
To access a clue, a PC typically needs to make a test
that corresponds to their approach, though actions like
offering an enticing bribe might circumvent a test at
the GM’s discretion.
When a PC fails to pursue a lead, they (or another
character) can usually attempt again, unless the story
causes that lead to run dry. However, each failure leads
the group closer to the failure threshold, so reattempts
should be made carefully. If a lead does run dry, usually
other leads can still point the way to the final objective.
A good investigative web has many paths to the solution,
allowing the group to explore the investigation in a wide
variety of directions.

JESSICA LIU

Example Investigative Web
The Investigative Web diagram depicts how the GM
might structure clues for the player characters to
discover. In this Discovery, an artifabrian friend in
Thaylen City implores the PCs to investigate missing
fabrial schematics. The artifabrian, an apprentice
named Kyrsn, worries she’ll lose her apprenticeship
if she doesn’t find the papers before her babsk, Tysri,
discovers the loss.

```
The GM begins the endeavor by revealing
the following information from Kyrsn: A shady
character has been seen around the workshop late
at night. Tysri recently shipped an order of heating
fabrials, and the schematics could’ve been mixed in
accidentally. Tysri’s main competitor, an artifabrian
named Gvalkn, is notoriously jealous of Tysri. Kyrsn
believes the schematics went missing sometime in
the last two days.
```

```
Metallurgist
The heatrials went to a metal-
lurgist named Vrain. He lives a
lavish lifestyle despite his modest
business.
```

```
Smuggler’s Trove
Searching Vrain’s workshop
reveals a false back wall. The
business is a front for a smuggling
operation where Vrain avoids
Thaylen trade taxes and
regulations.
```

```
Investigator
The hooded figure is Shara, a
scribe from the Thaylen Gemstone
Reserve who hasn’t been able to
secure a meeting with Tysri.
```

```
Suspicious Transactions
Shara has evidence that implicates
Kyrsn in a series of illegal deals
with a metallurgist named Vrain.
```

```
Kyrsn Framed
Studying the documents reveals
they are forgeries. Tysri has
betrayed Kyrsn, setting the
apprentice up to take the fall
for Tysri’s own crimes!
```

```
Secret Backers
Interrogating Vrain or searching
through his hidden ledgers reveals
his connection to a group of
corrupt Kharbranthian merchants.
Vrain and the merchants serve
a nefarious secret society called
the Diagram. The smugglers can’t
allow the PCs to live after this
discovery!
```

```
Sudden Fame
Until recently, Gvalkn’s designs
were considered substandard.
These days, he’s celebrated as
a rising star in fabrial science,
though there are whispers about
his unscrupulous nature.
```

```
Stolen Designs
Public records show two separate
accusations against Gvalkn for
stealing fabrial designs. Both
complaints were withdrawn and
settled outside the legal system.

```
Blackmail
Interviewing the artifabrians
reveals that Gvalkn blackmailed
them into silence.

Gvalkn’s Spies
Following or investigating Gvalkin
reveals that he pays spies to steal
other artifabrians’ designs. The
spies haven’t stolen anything from
Tysri yet, but Gvalkn or the spies
can reveal Tysri is in significant
debt to a smuggler named Vrain.

Describing the Setting
The GM can use sensory details to add flavor and depth
to a new setting, foreshadow danger, and hint at helpful
resources. These details are most interesting when
they use different senses and strive to evoke a variety
of emotions. Sometimes, the absence of something the
characters expect to sense creates a feeling of unease.
While some descriptions of a setting act as warnings,
others equip savvy players with useful information for
considering environmental solutions to their problems.
Progressing an Exploration
Once the Exploration begins, the GM prompts their
players with problems to solve, choices to make, and
chances to learn about their surroundings. Contributions
during an Exploration come in many forms. Scouting,
```

```
The characters can use these leads to begin their
investigation. Lateral arrows in the chart below indicate
clues that link to those in another lead line as well.
```

###### Exploration Endeavors

```
In Exploration endeavors, characters traverse unpre-
dictable or precarious environments—ones with an
inhospitable climate, hidden traps, or similar dangers.
Some Explorations feature treacherous travel to a known
location, while others depict a search for something
important in an unknown one. For example, the party
might take a merchant ship from Thaylen City to
Kharbranth, recover gear from the fallen during chasm
duty in the Shattered Plains, or map a floor of the newly
rediscovered city of Urithiru.
```

```
Running an Exploration
The setting of an Exploration adds texture and flavor
to the challenges the players face along the way. During
these endeavors, danger is everywhere. Sometimes it
seems as if Roshar itself acts in opposition to those living
on it. In the uncharted wilds, death awaits those unable
to identify an edible plant, find a safe water source,
fend off predators, or take shelter from an approaching
highstorm.
Regardless of the party’s intended objective for an
Exploration, it’s imperative they remain vigilant when
assessing environmental threats and managing their
resources. This is reflected in the Against the Odds
test they make together when faced with perilous
circumstances (see “Special Rule: Against the Odds”).
Although most Explorations represent time in transit,
being intentional about these endeavors offers more
than a means to an end. Along the way, characters
might find useful information, unexpected allies, and
breathtaking views.
Determining the Objective
Every Exploration has an objective. Most commonly,
this is traveling to a particular destination or sourcing
things within a specified area, but any endeavor where
the environment is the primary focus is an Exploration.
If the characters are traveling, they should form
a plan for reaching their intended destination. The
GM may suggest multiple methods or routes for
the players to choose from, as well as an estimated
distance or time for the journey’s duration. If the
Exploration has an objective other than travel, such
as clearing a road of large debris after an Everstorm,
the GM quantifies how much progress is required for
a successful endeavor.
```

```
Chapter 12: Endeavors 329
```

VLADIMIR ISHELIN (LEFT); LOGAN FELICIANO (RIGHT)

```
foraging, sneaking, setting up shelter, fending off
enemies, exchanging information with a passing
merchant, and making sense of a damaged map are
examples of what characters might do with different skill
sets. When a character has a relevant expertise or reward,
such as a patron whose influence is strong in the region,
they can use these resources to automatically succeed
on certain tests as the GM sees fit.
Characters with goals related to environmental
research or forming diplomatic relations may even get
a chance to progress their personal goals during an
Exploration.
Resolution
Once the objective of the Exploration is met, such as
crossing the necessary distance to reach a destination
or searching for and obtaining the items of interest,
the characters succeed in the Exploration endeavor.
If the characters have too many failed contributions or
get spectacularly sidetracked, the GM may decide the
Exploration failed, leaving the characters to decide how
to continue on without accomplishing what they set out
to do. Failing an Exploration might mean arriving at
a destination after another group has already taken an
important artifact from the ruins, or not being able to
procure agreed-upon goods for a crucial trade.
```

```
Special Rule: Against the Odds
Once per Exploration, a party may face perils above
and beyond the typical woes of wilderness survival
(and the tests they make to pursue their objective).
When the GM introduces these perils, each character
must make a related test—such as Survival, Athletics,
or Leadership—to face these perils and avoid their
consequences. Each character who fails their test suffers
the effects of the peril they are facing. The Against
the Odds Examples table gives some examples of
possible effects.
```

**Against the Odds Examples**

```

###### Mission Endeavors

```
Mission endeavors are urgent and tactically complex
scenes, such as infiltrating a hostile location, pulling off
a heist, or rescuing a hostage. Whether the characters
are in one of Dalinar’s highly trained strike teams or
just a scrappy pack of do-gooder citizens, they’ll need to
push the limits of their physical, cognitive, and spiritual
prowess to successfully complete their Mission.
```

```
Running a Mission
When planning a Mission, the GM defines a primary
objective and any secondary objectives that group
members might be interested in. They think through
what hindrances the party must overcome to reach their
objectives. Finally, the GM determines the amount of
in-game time the group has to complete the Mission
(see “Special Rule: Ticking Clock”); this is usually

elapsed, the issues begin. A servant could wake to fetch
a snack and see the characters, or the guards could
perform their regularly scheduled rotation and find
something amiss. The pressing nature of Missions place
player collaboration and party utility front and center.

Complication You spring a trap, or a guard happens to

```

based on the story around the Mission and what factors
threaten to disrupt it.
Since the stakes for Missions are so high, the GM
should prepare a list of relevant Opportunities and
Complications. The list of Complications should be
especially robust.

Mission Brief
To begin, the GM typically has an NPC share a
mission brief including a location, objectives (ranked
by priority), and in-game timeline with the characters.
Or if the PCs are assigning themselves the Mission
instead of responding to a quest-giver, they outline their
own objectives, then the GM introduces the location
and imposes the target timeline. When applicable,
the GM might include a preview of corresponding
outcomes for each completed objective.

Maintain Urgency
Every round of a Mission should feel tense and
unpredictable. The GM should raise the stakes on
most rolls, feeding a sense of urgency. Players race
against a ticking clock, working together to complete
their objectives before time runs out and all hell breaks
loose. At any point, the players may abandon certain
objectives to spare themselves from a terrible fate as
Complications pile up. Even the best strike teams know
when to cut their losses and get out of dodge.

Special Rule:

The Ticking Clock

Before the Mission begins, the GM decides approx-
imately how much time the party has to safely complete
it. When each round is completed, the GM advances
the clock. Additionally, when a PC rolls a Complication,
the GM can spend it to advance the clock if they so
choose (the time advanced is up to the GM).
With enough Complications or time spent, the
characters eventually exceed the target timeline, and
the GM hints at impending danger. Each additional
round played past the GM’s timeline triggers issues
of increasing severity that compound and threaten
to upend the group’s quest.
For example, perhaps the party is breaking into
the estate of a high-ranking vizier in the middle of the
night. They might go unnoticed for twenty minutes,
with every Complication advancing the clock by five
minutes (though the GM is free to vary this from one
Complication to the next). Once twenty minutes have

```

```

```
Chapter 12: Endeavors 331
```

###### Pursuit Endeavors

```
Chase scenes are all about staying in the moment and
the pursuer adapting to match the target’s cleverness
and drive. If the characters fail, they might never get
another chance to apprehend their target—or if they’re
the ones being pursued, the outcome could be even
more dire. In Roshar, Pursuit endeavors take place
on land, in the air, or at sea.
```

```
Running a Pursuit
During the GM’s preparations, they should sketch a
map—for their own use, not the players—with a rough
route from the beginning of a Pursuit to wherever the
target is heading. This might be a map of a city, across
the Shattered Plains, through the Valley, or anywhere
else where a Pursuit might take place. Even a roughly
drawn map with general shapes and lines helps give
the GM ideas of where the target can go to evade the
pursuers as they close in.
```

```
To Map or Not to Map?
While grid maps can be used during Pursuits, theater-
of-the-mind gameplay may be less limiting, allowing
a grander scale and more flexible GM adaptations.
Pursuits can become less enjoyable when players
focus on counting squares instead of getting into the
spirit of the chase. To compensate for a lack of visual
information, the GM can treat the chase scene as a
montage, describing areas as they become visible to
the characters. However, if your group has a hard time
envisioning verbal descriptions or just prefers to have
a visual reference, feel free to give them a gridless map
that doesn’t focus on exact distances and character
placement.
```

```
Adapt to Shifting Surroundings
The GM should be as crafty as possible, adapting
the target’s (or pursuer’s) movements and actions
to challenge characters to the best of their abilities.
Especially if the GM avoids using a physical game map
and miniatures, they can keep innovating ways for the
target to stay ahead until the players reach the success
or failure threshold for the Pursuit.
```

Opposed Tests During Pursuits
Because of a Pursuit’s focus on testing your skills
directly against an opponent who is directly opposing
your efforts, these endeavors are the perfect opportunity
to use opposed tests (see “Difficulty Class” in chapter 3).
When choosing and resolving skill tests during
these endeavors, consider if your efforts are in direct
opposition to those of the target’s. For example, if you’re
trying to keep up with the target or spot them hiding
while they’re trying to lose you in back alleys, or if you’re
trying to grapple them to the ground, these would be
good uses of opposed tests.
GMs using a lot of opposed tests should be aware
that some NPC profiles (especially those of higher tiers)
will prove much more difficult targets than others. If the
target is testing skills they are particularly good at, it can
quickly lead to the group failing the Pursuit. Keep this
in mind as the scene progresses, adjusting the collective
threshold or opting for traditional tests against static
DCs as desired.

Special Rule:

Closing the Distance

A Pursuit is all about the distance between the pursuer
and the target. You’re not building up to a success or
failure, but instead bending every effort toward closing
the distance to your target or increasing the distance
from your pursuer.
Because of this, Pursuit endeavors don’t use the
normal collective threshold. Instead, the GM keeps a
**distance track** to represent how close the pursuer is
to the target. This doesn’t represent the actual physical
distance, but is instead an abstracted number that tracks
how close or far the pursuer is from catching the target.
To use the distance track, the GM chooses a starting
distance and an escape distance, then tracks the current
distance between them:

**Starting Distance.** When starting a Pursuit, the GM
decides how wide the initial gap is between the target
and the pursuers.
**Escape Distance.** The GM then decides how far away
from the pursuers the target needs to be to finally
escape and end the Pursuit.
**Current Distance.** The distance is the current gap
between the target and the pursuers. When a pursuer
succeeds on a test, the gap closes by 1, but when they
fail, the gap widens by 1. Similarly, when a target
succeeds on a test, the gap widens by 1, but when
they fail, the gap lessens by 1.

```
The Pursuit ends when the current distance either
reaches zero (meaning the target is caught) or reaches
the escape distance (meaning the target escapes).
The Closing the Distance table offers some suggested
distances.
```

Rico (playing Aj): I have an idea! Lisiril could threaten
to hurt the thieves with her Soulcaster if they ever steal
from the ardentia again.
Game Master (GM): Okay, we’ll add intimidating the
thieves as a secondary objective. You’re looking at
about an hour and a half round trip. That means you’ll
only have half an hour to complete your objectives;
this endeavor is simple enough, so we’ll say that’s
two rounds.
Rico (playing Aj): We can handle that! ...probably.
Game Master (GM): After some travel, you reach the
Impossible Falls. The adjoining windblade is imposing,
but there’s a gentle quality to the water as it flows
almost weightlessly. Using Tilb’s map, you find a cave
tucked into the side of the windblade. The clock is
ticking. Who wants to start the first round?
Taylor (playing Jhesh): I’m going to use Cohesion to
seal the entrance to the cave once we’re inside. That
way, they can’t sneak out with the sapphire while
we’re trying to find them.
Game Master (GM): Okay, no need to test Cohesion—
just spend 1 Investiture and you can seal the five-foot
entrance. It’s dark now. You all rely on sight, so
your senses are obscured as you use spherelight
to navigate the cave.
Taylor records spending 1 Investiture.
```

###### Example Endeavor

```
This example of gameplay illustrates the flow of an
endeavor. Lisiril, Jhesh, and Aj have been recruited
to recover a sapphire gemstone stolen from the
Devotary of Insight in Kholinar, one which contains
a captive awespren.
Game Master (GM): Tilb, the ardent, hands you
a map. “The Impossible Falls are here, along this
windblade. The thieves keep a hideout in a nearby
cave. I’ve marked it with this glyph. Do hurry. If you
aren’t back in two hours, the lead ardent will notice
the sapphire is missing. If she realizes I used to be
friends with the thieves, she’ll think I was in on it.”
Now, this endeavor is a Mission. You have two hours
of in-game time to bring the awespren sapphire back to
the Devotary of Insight. Are there any other objectives
you want to add?
Taylor (playing Jhesh): Maybe we can stop the thieves
for good. What if we gather evidence from their
hideout and give it to the guards?
Mia (playing Lisiril): If we get the guards involved,
they’ll open an investigation and Tilb could be
implicated.

the d20 with a_ **4** _on the plot die. He adds his Stealth
modifier of +4, along with the +4 from the plot die, for a
total of 10. That’s lower than the thieves’ Spiritual defense
(which the GM set as the DC)._

```
Rico (playing Aj): Uh, that’s a 10 with a Complication.
Game Master (GM): You find the four thieves quickly.
They’re in a small cavern through the left tunnel.
Unfortunately, they notice you as you slide over. And
to add a Complication, one of them cuts the sphere
pouch from your belt and pockets it.
```

_Rico records that he now has zero marks._

```
Mia (playing Lisiril): Oh, by Vedeledev’s golden
keys! We don’t have time for a lengthy confrontation.
I’m going to have my spren Scriven try to covertly
scout the polestone's location while the thieves are
distracted with Aj.
Game Master (GM): Make a Perception test for
him, but raise the stakes because the thieves are
already alerted!
```

_Mia rolls a d20 along with the plot die, rolling a 14 on
the d20 with a_ **2** _on the plot die. She adds her Perception
modifier of +3, along with the+2 from the plot die, for a
total of 19. That’s higher than the DC the GM set._
**Game Master (GM):** Scriven's inky form blends with
the darkness as he slinks off to look around. Shortly
afterward, he returns and says he thinks he’s found it!
It’s hidden away in a cubby in the cave wall just to your
left. Unfortunately, the cubby is cut from the other
side, down a tunnel past the thieves. With that said,
on to the second round!
**Rico (playing Aj):** Now this is personal! I’m going to
tell the thieves I brought my ardent friend with me
who has a Soulcaster. If they don’t cooperate or try to
steal from the ardents again, she’ll turn them all into
crem with it!
**Mia (playing Lisiril):** That doesn’t make any sense.
Crem isn’t one of the ten Essences.
**Rico (playing Aj):** Yeah, but they don’t know that!
Okay, I’m testing Intimidation, right?
**Game Master (GM):** Yes, but with a disadvantage
because the thieves don’t believe you have
anyone with you.

```
Rico rolls two d20s and gets an 18 and 11. Because of the
disadvantage, the GM chooses the 11 since it’s the lower
result. Rico adds his Intimidation modifier of +5 to that
d20 roll, for a total of 16. That’s higher than the thieves’
Cognitive defense (which the GM set as the DC).
Game Master (GM): Your words give the thieves pause.
They begin squabbling about whether stealing from
the Almighty’s church brought them bad luck. Time is
running out though. What are Jhesh and Lisiril doing?
Taylor (playing Jhesh): I’m going to Stoneshape to find
where the awespren sapphire is hidden in the wall.
Game Master (GM): Test Cohesion this time and
raise the stakes!
Taylor records that they spent 1 Investiture. They roll
a d20 along with the plot die, rolling a natural 20 with
a blank on the plot die. They add their Cohesion modifier
of +5 to the d20 roll, for a total of 25. That’s higher than
the DC the GM set—and they have an Opportunity,
thanks to the natural 20!
Game Master (GM): Wow! You reach into the rock and
grasp for the sapphire, finding it almost immediately in
a hidden compartment. With the Opportunity, you also
find a small box with a single dose of effectual poison.
Mia (playing Lisiril): I’m going to run into the cavern
Aj is in and signal that it’s time to go. Then I’ll use
Transformation on the stone door Jhesh made at
the entrance of the cave, turning it into water so we
can leave.
Mia rolls a d20 and gets a 9. She adds her Transformation
modifier of +6 for a total of 15. That’s the same as the
DC set by the Transformation test rules. Since the stone
is Medium size, she spends 2 Investiture.
Game Master (GM): The thieves cower upon seeing
you, an ardent, with a Soulcaster. You’re not wearing
the ceremonial red robes of a Soulcaster ardent; in
their state of fear, this convinces them that you’re not
bound by the ardentia’s ban on using Soulcasters on
living beings. They believe Aj that you’d turn them to
crem. That’s the end of the second round. Good job,
you’ve successfully completed both objectives of your
Mission in the nick of time! Now, when you return
to the Devotary of Insight...

## Gamemastering

```
The First Step
When you’re ready to dive into GMing, the first step
is to gather your party of players. Whether you’re
arranging a scheduled single-session game (often called
a one-shot) or a long campaign with many sessions, it’s
important to set expectations with all of your players.
Scheduling
One of the hardest parts of maintaining an ongoing
roleplaying campaign is scheduling, so check with all
your players ahead of time. Set expectations for how
many sessions you think your campaign will run, how
often you’ll meet, and how long you expect the average
session to take.
```

```
Theme
Before players commit, it’s a good idea to let everyone
know what the adventure’s theme will be. Are you
expecting a harrowing tale of warfare on the Shattered
Plains? A relaxing tale on the Purelake? A silly jaunt
through the Reshi Isles? Make sure your players are
on board with the vibe you’re hoping to evoke.
Safety
As you discuss the theme, it’s equally important to touch
base on what each person in the group needs to be safe,
comfortable, and fully themselves. The “Safety Guide”
section at the end of this chapter provides guidance on
getting everyone on the same page about what topics
and behaviors everyone is comfortable with.
```

```
Setting Knowledge
Players can enjoy this game without any prior knowledge
of the Stormlight Archive novels. As GM, it’ll be easier
to guide a story everyone can share if you find out how
familiar each player is with the novels. Roshar and the
wider cosmere are complex, including a lot of nuanced
history and magic systems. Discovering what each player
knows helps you to present information in a way that’ll
be approachable for those who need it, and deep for
those who can appreciate it.
```

hile the rest of this rulebook
primarily targets the players and their
experiences in the game, the remainder
of these pages are speaking directly to you, the Game
Master. Taking on the role of GM can be a daunting
task. After all, your other players just have to worry
about their one character; meanwhile, you have to
juggle them plus a whole cast of NPCs and how they
fit in the story of a grand adventure!
Luckily, the rules of the game have been designed
to help make your job easy. The plot die, Opportunities,
and Complications empower the players to help you tell
the story, and the different scene types offer support
for adjudicating tricky situations. Once you get into the
rhythm of play, GMing a game can be an incredibly
fun and rewarding experience.
```

###### Getting Started

```
Many books and online resources offer general guidance
about how to structure RPG storylines and employ
different styles of running a game. If you’re interested
in GMing for the first time, researching and reading
about different approaches can help provide a general
foundation. This chapter doesn’t focus on that kind of
higher-level advice (though you can certainly run this
game without reading other resources). Instead, it guides
you on using the unique systems of this game—and the
unique features of Roshar—to run a compelling game.
Ultimately, your main goal as GM is to create a
memorable, safe, and entertaining experience for
your players, and to ensure that everyone at your table
(including you) has a good time. Remember that you’re
the adjudicator of the game—what you say goes. This
book’s rules and guidance are here to help you along,
but they’re just tools to be used when you need them,
and to be disregarded when you don’t. Feel free to bend
and break rules presented here, adapting the game to
create the best experience possible at your table.

###### Calling for Skill Tests

```
There’s no right answer on how often you should call
for skill tests (see “Skills” in chapter 3). As GM, feel free
to find the balance that’s right for you and your group.
Some GMs prefer to focus mainly on roleplaying and
storytelling; these GMs usually save dice rolls for critical
moments that really need that randomness, and the rest
of the time, they resolve situations based on roleplaying
and the abilities of the PCs. Other GMs like to call
for tests often, thinking on their feet and improvising
outcomes as the dice lead the story in interesting new
directions. If you’re wondering whether to call for a test,
ask yourself a few questions:
Is there a chance of both success and failure?
As you determine the difficulty of a task, if it’s so easy
(or difficult) for a given character that there’s almost
no chance of success (or failure), it might not be worth
rolling. In these cases, you can just narrate the results
without a test.
Will this change the story? Ask yourself how the
success or failure of a test will impact the story or the
party’s immediate surroundings. If it won’t change
anything, it’s usually not worth rolling.
Could this introduce interesting ramifications?
Regardless of the test’s success or failure, could the
character’s actions cause other things to occur? If so,
you can have them raise the stakes on their test to see
if the plot die generates any interesting side effects.
```

###### Using the Plot Die

```
The plot die is a powerful storytelling tool for creating
dynamic, exciting, and unpredictable moments in your
games. In times of tension, it can inspire the PC to
greater feats than they thought possible. In times of
failure, it can be a glimmer of hope that gives the PC
the push they need to keep going. Whether the plot
die prompts outstanding success, crushing failure, or
success at a cost, this helps create powerful stories that
you and your players will joyously (or commiseratingly)
recount for years to come.
```

```
Raising the Stakes
As GM, you choose when to raise the stakes on a skill
test, prompting the player to include the plot die in their
roll (see “Using Cosmere RPG Dice” in this book’s
introduction). Knowing when and how to do so is key.
If you raise the stakes too often, it stops being exciting,
but if you use the plot die too sparingly, you miss out on
its storytelling power.
The plot die needn’t be used just on important and
tense tests; you can raise the stakes to highlight any
```

```
Character Creation
Once you have your group gathered, it’s time to create
characters! You can either have players do this ahead
of time, or you can run an introductory “session zero”
where everyone makes their characters together at the
game table.
No matter how you approach it, it’s important to
let the players know what level they’re starting at; this
is usually level 1, but the “Starting at Higher Levels”
section of this chapter discusses other options. Also
tell players about any story considerations they need to
keep in mind as they fit their characters into the world;
do all their characters need to start the game as part of
a bridge crew, or does the story assume they’re all part
of the Azish court?
```

```
Finding the Right Characters
It’s important each of your players is happy with their
character and how their mechanical abilities match up
with their unfolding narrative. If one of your players isn’t
happy with an element of their character mid-campaign,
consider allowing them to make modifications to their
character. The “Downtime” section of chapter 9 presents
a Self-Reflection option, which allows the player—with
a little investment of time and spheres—to change their
character as much as they desire. This is a great option
for changes that are driven by what has happened to the
character as the story unfolds.
However, sometimes a player is fundamentally
disappointed with the choices they made during
character creation and advancement (whether they
regret just a single talent or their entire build). In these
cases, consider waiving the downtime requirement and
letting them immediately rebuild the character at no
cost. Remember that the rules are there to support
everyone’s fun, not to limit it!
```

```
Who Are the Rules Speaking To?
Throughout the rest of this rulebook, the rules directly
address the players as “you.” However, this doesn’t mean
the guidance throughout is only for player characters! Any
rules that apply to the PCs also apply to NPCs under your
control. They can make tests, use actions in combat, and
play an active role in the story too.
The main difference between PCs and NPCs is how
they’re constructed. The Stormlight World Guide and most
published adventures provide NPC profiles and stat blocks
(see “Using Adversaries” later in this chapter). These stat
blocks use many of the same statistics as PCs, but they
don’t follow the same rules for character creation, and
they may have special abilities that PCs don’t.
```

**338** Chapter 13: Gamemastering

```
another character. You might point out this relevance as
the GM, or a player might decide the scenario pertains
to them and ask to raise the stakes. Either way, you can
do so to highlight the significance of the moment.
Plot Twists
In both conversations and endeavors, look for key skill
tests of importance, tension, and danger, when the
sudden appearance of an Opportunity or Complication
could change the course of the session or a character’s
story. Whether an Opportunity causes a previously
unseen route of ingress to become apparent, or a
Complication causes the alarm to be raised and forces
a change in tack, these moments simulate the twists and
turns of the best stories, and thus are ideal points to
inject the plot die.
Difficult Choices
Especially if your Mission has a time limit, you can use
the plot die to offer a choice: does the party want a slow
and safe option, or a quicker option with greater risk?
While infiltrating Kholinar, perhaps the players learn
that the highlord they’re supposed to rescue is scheduled
to be executed the following day at noon. You could
ask the party, “Would you like to take time to bribe a
merchant to hide you among their wares, or do you want
to attempt to sneak past the guards while the gates are
already open? The merchant option will take a few hours
and cost 10 marks per person, which you might be able
to reduce with a successful Persuasion test. The sneak-
ing option can happen immediately, but it’ll require
a Stealth test on which we’ll raise the stakes.” This
leaves the agency in the players’ hands while creating
a compelling choice about risks versus rewards.
Plot Dice in Combat
Whether the party gets caught somewhere on their
way to the highprince or they need to battle the guards
posted at his cell, there’s a strong chance combat
will occur at least once during the party’s infiltration
of Kholinar.
Dramatic Moments
Just like with conversations and endeavors, you
shouldn’t have a player raise the stakes on every single
attack or other test they make in a combat scene; though
each test technically contributes to the Mission, it’s
best to focus on highlighting important moments in
the combat.
Was a party member just reduced to 0 health and
the remaining PCs realize their numbers are rapidly
becoming overwhelmed? Consider raising the stakes on
the first test each of those characters makes during their
next turn to simulate the spike in fear and adrenaline.
```

test as important to the story, a character, or the game
session. For example, you might raise the stakes when a
character attempts a creative solution to a problem, or
when a player leans into their character’s motivations
(such as choosing a “suboptimal” plan because it’s
consistent with the character’s beliefs).
Keep in mind that the plot die doesn’t reflect how
hard a test is—that’s what advantages and disadvantages
are for—but rather how important a test is in the
narrative. As a general guideline, you should be raising
the stakes on roughly a third of the tests being rolled,
though this varies depending on how often you call for
tests. When the PCs are in an intense story scene, you
might raise the stakes on nearly every test, while casual
side activities might not raise the stakes at all.
This section outlines scenarios in which you likely
should or shouldn’t use the plot die.

Plot Dice Outside of Combat
As an example of using plot dice outside of combat, let’s
say the group is on a Mission to sneak into Voidbringer-
occupied Kholinar to rescue a captive highlord.

**Lower-Stakes Activities**
As the PCs prepare for their infiltration, they’ll likely
perform reconnaissance or information-gathering
about weak points in the city’s walls, seek rumors
from traveling merchants as to the highlord’s possible
location, or make disguises to pass as servants. While
these activities all contribute to their quest, you don’t
need to raise the stakes on every test made in pursuit
of that goal. None of these activities carry exceptional
risk and the story likely wouldn’t be enhanced by raising
the stakes.

**Higher-Stakes Activities**
However, if the party’s information-gathering leads
them to an NPC who may be likely to report back to the
Fused to curry favor, if they try to convince a singer to
betray the Fused and help them, or if they try to steal
a key piece of equipment from a supply caravan, that
might create enough danger to merit raising the stakes.
Similarly, once the party begins their infiltration, danger
and tension abound, so a Stealth or Deception test to
get through the city gates or an Athletics test to scale
the high walls would be heightened by the rolling of
a plot die.

**Meaningful Moments**
The same is true for specific character moments that
happen throughout the preparation and the infiltration
itself. Each PC has a purpose, obstacle, and at least
one goal that can make a particular test especially
meaningful for them in a way that it might not be for

```
Chapter 13: Gamemastering 339
```

```
you may be surprised by how much harsher the players’
recommendations are than what you had in mind, and
how willing (and even delighted) players can be for their
characters to suffer for the sake of a good story.
Increasing Player Agency
In addition to taking some of the cognitive load off you,
collaborating on the plot die gives your players greater
agency in what’s happening. They’ll likely become more
invested, paying closer attention to the scenario and
their characters’ environment so they can give the most
fitting suggestions. When the stakes are raised, this can
excite the whole group—they don’t know whether it’s
good or bad, but they’re sure something interesting is
about to happen.
Encourage the group to get into pitching ideas and
collaborating on what outcomes would be the most fun
or satisfying for the story. The plot die is at its most fun
when everyone is involved. Ultimately though, it’s up
to you as the GM to decide whether a given narrative
outcome is allowed, and in the case of Complication,
how it is spent.
```

###### Using Opportunities

###### and Complications

```
After the stakes are raised and the plot die is rolled, it’s
time to resolve the consequences. As described in this
book’s introduction, when a PC gains an Opportunity
or Complication, it can be resolved in several ways:
```

◆ (^) An ally gains an advantage (on an Opportunity) or a
disadvantage (on a Complication) on their next test.
◆ (^) The PC gains 1 focus (on an Opportunity) or loses
1 focus (on a Complication).
◆ (^) A hit becomes a critical hit (on an Opportunity).
◆ (^) A narrative side effect occurs.
The fourth option is where the game can take on a
life of its own: tests causing unforeseen consequences
that keep the story moving in unexpected and fun
directions. Coming up with what an Opportunity or
Complication could represent is a creative exercise that
can deepen the storytelling experience at your table—
but it can also be daunting. What sorts of narrative
elements should these results introduce? What if you
don’t have any ideas?
This section offers guidance on how to use
Opportunities and Complications productively. Don’t
implement all these approaches at once. Instead, use
them as different lenses to view Opportunities and
Complications through, giving you inspiration for
how to handle them.
Did a Fused suddenly appear around a corner and
become locked in a one-on-one death match with a PC?
Consider raising the stakes on each attack that character
makes during their turn.
Is one of the PCs a Willshaper who sees all the people
in chains within the prison? Consider raising the stakes
on some tests that directly pertain to freeing those
people from bondage, such as attacking the guards or
attempting to free the prisoners and get their help in
the fight.
**Carefully Chosen Moments**
In general, the plot die should be used less in combat
than outside of it, since even small Opportunities and
Complications can have a significant impact on the
flow of combat. Finding a few key places to raise the
stakes can make a fight feel more dynamic and exciting,
especially in fights against significant villains.
Don’t use the plot die too sparingly, however. Several
talents provide special ways of spending Opportunities,
so players will appreciate the ability to use them more
often. On the flip side, some adversaries have special
uses for Complications, so you can terrify your players
by using these abilities.
Collaborative Plot Die Use
After the plot die is rolled, it’s your role as the GM to
help adjudicate the results of the test. Beyond resolving
how well the goal of the test was accomplished, you also
help resolve any Opportunities or Complications. Each
symbol on the plot die has standard mechanical effects,
but a session can be made more dynamic if the group
can come up with narrative results that play into the
current situation.
Players Asking to Raise the Stakes
Remember that you’re not alone as the GM! You have a
game full of other players who are also invested in telling
a compelling story. To that end, encourage your players
to ask to raise the stakes when they feel events are brush-
ing up against their purpose, obstacle, and goals. This
frees you to think about when raising the stakes makes
sense for the wider scenario, rather than also worrying
about each individual PC.
Players Suggesting Outcomes
When an Opportunity or Complication is rolled,
you don’t need to come up with every possible effect or
outcome; instead, open the floor for players to give their
own suggestions! With an Opportunity, the player who
rolled it can decide how it’s used. With a Complication,
**340** Chapter 13: Gamemastering

```
Another Axis
Some GMs might like to think about the results of a
test as a graph with an X and Y axis—one of which rep-
resents the test result itself, the other of which represents
Opportunities and Complications. For example, imagine
a character making a Thievery test to pick a lock.
On one axis lies the character’s goal in making the
test. Were they testing how well they could pick a lock,
how fast they could pick it, or how silently? Their main
objective lies on this axis, and their result determines
how close they are to success or failure; it’s not a mere
question of passing or failing, as you can scale the effects
of success or failure depending on the result.
On the second axis lies any potential outcomes
beyond the character’s main objective. If the character’s
primary objective was to see how well they could pick
the lock, this second axis might represent how fast
they can pick it. Where the character lands on this
secondary axis depends on their Opportunities and
Complications. If they were trying to open a difficult
lock, an Opportunity might mean they completed it in
record time. Or if they were trying to pick a lock rapidly
under pressure, a Complication might mean they break
their picking tools in the process. This axis doesn’t
change the success or failure of their primary objective,
but it certainly affects other aspects of the scene.
```

```
Alternate Skills
You can also think about what other skills that character
has access to, and how those skills could come into play
with their test. On an Opportunity or Complication,
one of these other skills might affect the outcome.
For example, a character could be grappling with
an opponent using Athletics—but when they roll an
Opportunity, their Thievery might allow them to pick
that opponent’s pocket at the same time. (Alternatively,
a Complication could mean the opponent did the same
thing right back to them!)
```

```
Dumb Luck
Opportunities and Complications needn’t always
directly relate to the character taking the test. Instead,
they can represent incidental events happening at the
same time, such as acts of luck or happenstance.
For example, when a character attempts to deceive a
crowd and rolls a Complication, they might realize that
someone they used to know is among the crowd; this
doesn’t have anything to do with their ability to deceive
the crowd, but it could certainly present challenges later.
Meanwhile, a character fighting aboard a Thaylen ship
could roll an Opportunity that causes their opponent to
tangle a leg in the rigging.
```

```
Advancing the Story
Ultimately, Opportunities and Complications are tools
to help deepen the story and move it in interesting
directions. So if you plan to reveal a certain event or
plot twist in a given scene, why not tie it to the roll of
an Opportunity or Complication?
Maybe you were planning on bandits ambushing the
party later in the scene. Instead of them just popping
up, you could wait until for a Complication and have
the bandits choose that moment to appear. Tying these
events to the plot die helps them feel like a natural part
of the system unfolding instead of a contrived story beat.
Some Opportunities might allow a PC to learn a
secret that the players don’t even know to ask for; if such
an Opportunity presents itself, you can offer to reveal an
important secret, and let the player choose whether to
use their Opportunity on that.
```

```
Chapter 13: Gamemastering 341
```

ANNA PAZYNIUK

```
Using Events
Sometimes, you might have side effects in mind that are
just too big in scope to trigger after a single Opportunity
or Complication. In these cases, you can lead up to an
event (see “Events” in chapter 9) by collecting multiple
Opportunities and Complications.
```

###### Narrative Advantages

###### and Disadvantages

```
It can be challenging to decide when to add advan-
tages or disadvantages to a test (see “Advantages and
Disadvantages” in chapter 3). Keep an eye out for times
when a character has unique context related to a test (or
has less context than usual). In these situations, you can
reflect how their background grants them an advantage
(or disadvantage) on the test.
From a mechanical standpoint, two characters with
the same statistics have the same likelihood of succeed-
ing on a test with a given DC. Advantage and disadvan-
tage help you highlight aspects of each character’s story,
so look for times when the test is on a niche subject that
would give a particular character different odds.
Many GMs feel more confident in adding advantages
to tests than they do disadvantages. When a character
makes a test on a subject they have little to no context
for, a narrative disadvantage is usually appropriate. For
example, a character with a high Thievery modifier
is generally good at picking locks, but if they’ve never
encountered a fabrial-enhanced lock before they try
to pick it, you could add a disadvantage to their test to
account for this unfamiliar application.
```

###### Structuring a Game Session

```
Depending on your play style, a single session of
the game could be rigidly structured, or you could
improvise based on your inspiration in the moment.
But regardless of your approach to storytelling, the
story unfolds via different scenes leading into each
other, based on your needs in the story (see “Scenes”
in chapter 9). A Discovery endeavor to search Thaylen
City for a missing informant might lead to a convers-
ation with a back-alley merchant, leading to another
conversation with her underworld contacts, leading
to a combat with their gang members, leading to a
Pursuit endeavor across the city when the party realizes
they’re outmatched. And all the while, an event could
be looming on the horizon: the arrival of the Everstorm
(see “Events” in chapter 9).
Between scenes, when the party has a chance to
rest or engage in downtime (either because they need
it to heal up or because of a lull in the story), you
```

```
can punctuate those moments of respite by using the
guidance in the “Resting” and “Downtime” sections
of chapter 9.
```

```
How Many Scenes?
How many combat scenes should you prep between
long rests or moments of downtime? As with all rules
in this book, it depends on the needs of the story.
This game provides many ways for characters to roll
the recovery die, and they only need a long rest when
they’re incapable of continuing onward without one.
This gives a GM plenty of flexibility to fill an adventur-
ing day with however many scenes fit their narrative.
While planning and building combat scenes
(described in the next section), consider the difficulty
of the fights as a guideline. Several easy combats can
help players feel like heroes without straining them-
selves. A couple of medium scenes will test their tactics
as their resources steadily drain. One hard scene can
end the day—and a more challenging one could even
fill it—pushing the characters to and past their limits.
```

###### Using Adversaries

```
Chapter 8 of the Stormlight World Guide provides an
array of adversary profiles you can use in your adven-
tures, along with unique statistics for those characters.
Most published adventures also contain adversaries you
can use. Additionally, the animal companion stat blocks
in this book’s appendix follow the same format.
```

```
Profiles
Each adversary profile includes background information
about that adversary, followed by a “Tactics” section with
guidance if you’re uncertain how to run a specific stat
block in combat. However, those tactics are only sug-
gestions; feel free to adjust based on the flow of combat
and the needs of a scene. At the end of each profile, a
stat block presents the unique rules for that adversary.
```

```
Stat Blocks
Each adversary’s unique rules and statistics are detailed
in a special section called a stat block. Adversary stat
blocks offer a simplified version of the abilities and
statistics of player characters, making them easier to
run in combat. This page includes a sample stat block
from the Stormlight World Guide.
If you’re using a prewritten adventure and a scene
calls for you to introduce an adversary, the adventure
likely tells you which adversaries to use, and their names
appear in bold to indicate there’s a stat block available.
For example, if an adventure says “two axehounds
approach,” use the axehound stat block twice.
```

**342** Chapter 13: Gamemastering

```
Each stat block includes several components, detailed
in the following sections. Unless otherwise specified,
these follow the same rules as player characters.
Title
Depending on the adversary, their title might include
their species, function, or other descriptors. In adven-
tures, some major NPCs use a unique stat block with
their given name, while the adversaries in the Stormlight
World Guide have more general titles.
```

```
Details
Beneath the adversary’s title, you’ll find details such as
“Tier 2 Boss – Medium Humanoid.” This line provides
the following information:
Tier. The adversary’s tier helps you choose appropriately
challenging adversaries for each scene (see “Building
Combat Scenes” later in this chapter).
Role. Adversaries are divided into three roles: Min-
ion, Rival, and Boss. This represents their relative
importance within that tier and their complexity in
combat. See the following “Role” section for details
on each role.
```

```
Size. As with PCs, an adversary’s size reflects the space
they control in combat: Small (2.5 feet), Medium
(5 feet), Large (10 feet), Huge (15 feet), and
Gargantuan (20 feet or more, at GM discretion).
Type. An adversary’s type summarizes their fundamental
nature (such as humanoid or animal). There’s no finite
list of types and this doesn’t affect how their stat block
functions—type is merely a descriptive term. However,
when it fits the story, some effects might affect certain
adversary types (especially humanoids) in special ways.
Role
The second line of a stat block lists the adversary’s
role along with the other details. Each role follows
different rules:
Minion adversaries are weaker than other adversaries.
Each has the Minion feature: “The minion’s attacks
can’t critically hit, and they’re immediately defeated
when they suffer an injury.”
Rival adversaries have no additional rules and present
a standard challenge to adventurers.
Boss adversaries can challenge an entire party. They’re
more threatening—and more complex to run—than

Quick Hands. When a character triggers a Reactive

Vanishing Act. At the end of the thief’s turn, if they’re in cover
or in an area where their enemy’s primary sense is obscured,
the thief can make a Stealth test (no action required) with
advantage against the Spiritual defense of each enemy who
can sense them. Each enemy they succeed against loses track
of them and can no longer sense them until the thief attacks
or takes another action that would expose them.

Strike: Dagger. Attack +5, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft.,

keen damage.
On a hit or graze, if the target is Disoriented, they take
an extra 2 (1d4) keen damage.
Disorienting Distraction (Costs 1 Focus). The thief
throws sand, flour, or a similar substance to distract and
confuse foes. Each enemy within 10 feet of them must
succeed on a DC 13 Agility test or become Disoriented
until the end of the thief’s next turn.
Pickpocket (Costs 2 Focus). The thief attempts to
rifle through the belongings of a humanoid within 5 feet of
them, making an opposed Thievery test against the target’s
Perception. If the target is Disoriented, the target gains a
disadvantage on their test. If the thief succeeds, they can
choose to steal up to 50 marks or one item the target isn’t
wielding or wearing.
Slippery. After an enemy ends a Move action within
5 feet of the thief, the thief can use the Disengage
action as. If the thief ends this movement in cover or
in an area where an enemy’s primary sense is obscured,
enemies affected by that cover or obscured senses gain
a disadvantage on attacks against the thief until the end
of the thief’s next turn.
```

```
Chapter 13: Gamemastering 343
```

```
the final blow can choose for the NPC to fall Uncon-
scious with an injury.
Defeated NPCs remain Unconscious until they
recover at least 1 health from another source; they
can’t voluntarily regain consciousness like a PC.
Deflect Value
An adversary’s deflect value represents their armor,
natural defenses, and special abilities. As with PCs,
reduce all incoming impact, keen, and energy damage
by the listed deflect value. If an adversary has no deflect
value listed, their value is 0.
Immediately following this value, parentheses name
the primary source of this protection (such as “leather”).
In some cases, this name is merely for flavor—but if the
name of the source matches with a piece of armor from
chapter 7, the PCs may be able to acquire it after the
enemy is defeated.
```

```
Movement
As with PCs, an adversary’s movement rate determines
how far they can travel during the Move action.
A few stat blocks include special movement
capabilities, such as swimming or flying. Unlike PCs,
adversaries don’t gain the Slowed condition from any
movement types listed in their stat block.
Senses
As with PCs, an adversary’s senses range determines
the limit of their senses when their primary sense is
obscured. Each stat block indicates which primary sense
is common for that adversary, but you can change it to
whichever sense fits an individual NPC’s story.
A few adversaries have special capabilities or limit-
ations to their senses, as noted in parentheses after their
sense range.
```

```
Immunities
Some adversaries are immune to certain effects (usually
conditions). For example, if a stat block is immune to
Immobilized, they can move freely despite being targeted
with abilities that inflict the Immobilized condition.
As with all rules in this game, these immunities are
up to GM discretion, and your players might find a
creative way to bypass an adversary’s immunities.
Skills
Adversaries can use any skill from chapter 3, but for sim-
plicity, stat blocks only lists the skills they have ranks in.
These are divided into Physical, Cognitive, and Spiritual,
though not every adversary has ranks in each category.
If you want to use a skill whose modifier isn’t listed,
just use the adversary’s associated attribute for that
modifier (for example, adding their Strength attribute
to an Athletics test).
```

```
other adversaries. Each has the Boss feature: “The boss
can take both a fast turn and a slow turn each round.
After an enemy finishes a turn, the boss can spend
1 focus to immediately use an extra or. Addition-
ally, they can spend 1 focus on their turn to remove a
condition from themself.”
If you’re planning combat encounters of your own
making, each role presents a different level of threat,
as described in the upcoming “Building Combat
Scenes” section.
Attributes and Defenses
Adversaries use the same basic statistics as PCs,
including the six attributes (Strength, Speed, Intellect,
Willpower, Awareness, and Presence) and three defenses
(Physical, Cognitive, and Spiritual).
If these seem like they don’t match up with other
numbers in the stat block, never fear; many stat blocks
invisibly apply bonuses or penalties (much like a PC
talent might), so sometimes a modifier or other statistic
may be different than you’d expect.
```

```
Health, Focus, and Investiture
As with PCs, adversaries have health, focus, and (in
some cases) Investiture.
Current and Maximum
The listed value for each of these resources represents
both their maximum and current value. If the PCs
encounter the same NPC across multiple scenes,
consider whether the NPC had a chance to restore some
or all of these resources, or whether they’re starting the
next scene with less than their maximum.
Customizing Health
If you want to make an adversary a little easier or harder
to defeat, you can adjust their health using the range
provided in parentheses. For example, if an adversary’s
health is “60 (48–72),” you can use the default value
of 60, decrease it to 48, increase it to 72, or anything
in between.
Defeated Adversaries
When an adversary is reduced to 0 health, they are
defeated. This can play out in different ways depending
on the PC’s intent when attacking the adversary, the
GM’s desire for the story, and similar factors.
In battle, most adversaries are assumed dead after
being reduced to 0 health, as described in “Damage,
Injury, and Death” in chapter 9. However, at the GM’s
discretion, NPCs with a significant narrative role can
instead fall Unconscious and make injury rolls like PCs
do. Additionally, if the PCs are trying to defeat any
adversary with non-lethal means, the PC who deals
```

**344** Chapter 13: Gamemastering

```
Features
Adversary features provide special rules that affect
the adversary but don’t directly require an action, free
action, or reaction to use; these often function like a
PC’s “always active” or “special” abilities. For example,
a feature might allow an adversary to deal extra damage
under certain circumstances. See “Actions” below for
details on how to calculate statistics and spend resources
for these features.
```

```
Surge Skills
If an adversary can wield Investiture, their stat block
also lists their surge skills, along with the number of
ranks they have in that skill.
For ease of use, this game offers simplified versions
of the surges in each stat block’s features and actions.
The Investiture cost appears in parentheses after that
feature’s name (see chapter 6 for the rules on fueling
surges with Investiture). When using these simplified
surges, you don’t need to use the adversary’s surge
ranks and modifiers, as the feature or action already
accounts for them.
However, if you want the flexibility of the full surge
rules from chapter 6, feel free to use them! Refer to the
adversary’s listed ranks to determine the power and size
of their surge.
```

```
Languages
For adversaries who can speak or understand languages,
their stat block suggests what languages to use. However,
feel free to adjust these to match each individual NPC.
```

```
Ancestries and Abilities
Some of the stat blocks for humanoids indicate a particular
ancestry: for example, a warform singer is clearly a singer.
However, many stat blocks (such as the thief , guard , or
Shardbearer ) are intended to function for any humanoid
ancestry.
Feel free to alter stat blocks to represent an adversary’s
ancestry or other unique abilities. For example, you
could represent a singer guard by borrowing some of
the warform singer’s features and actions, or even by
adapting a couple PC talents from this handbook.
```

```

```
Duplicate Names
If an adversary’s stat block action matches the name
of an action from this handbook, these are considered
duplicate actions (even though the adversary version
may have some special features), so you can’t use both
on the same turn.
Calculations Included
If an action (or feature) requires a test or otherwise uses
the adversary’s statistics, the calculations are already
done for you. For example, each attack lists the modifier
for that test (“Attack +11”), so you don’t have to refer-
ence their skills to figure out what modifier to add.
Spending Resources
If an action (or other feature) requires spending the
adversary’s focus or Investiture, this cost is noted either
in parentheses after the action name (if you always spend
it to use that action), or in the text of the action (if other
considerations affect when you spend that resource).
```

```
Opportunities and Complications
Adversary tests can’t raise the stakes, and thus they
don’t typically roll the plot die. However, adversaries
can still be affected by Opportunities and Complications
in the following ways.
Adversary Die Rolls
Though adversaries don’t roll the plot die, they can
occasionally gain an Opportunity or Complication due
to their d20 roll (see “Opportunity and Complication
Ranges” in this book’s introduction).
PC Die Rolls
When a PC rolls a Complication during a scene, a
few adversaries (primarily bosses) have a special ability
you can spend that Complication on. However, this ability
brings with it a weakness: when a PC rolls an Opport unity,
they can spend it on that adversary’s Opportunity effect,
hampering the adversary in some way.
Opportunity and Complication Ideas
If an adversary rolls an Opportunity, you can use
any options provided in their stat block, or you can
choose another effect that fits the story. Consider the
following ideas:
```

◆ (^) The adversary or their ally gains an advantage on
their next test.
◆ (^) The adversary gains 1 focus, up to their maximum.
◆ (^) The adversary doesn’t have to spend focus or
Investiture on their next action that would usually
have a cost.
◆ (^) The adversary inflicts a condition on their target until
the start of the adversary’s next turn.
◆ (^) The narrative shifts slightly in the adversary’s favor.
Actions
Each stat block provides unique actions, free actions,
and/or reactions for that adversary. These follow the
same rules as PC actions do, so you can’t use the same
action more than once on a turn.
Adversaries can also use the actions, free actions,
and reactions listed in chapter 10; for example, any
adversary can (and often should) use the Move action,
the Gain Advantage action, and the Reactive Strike
reaction. Rosharan adversaries with an Investiture pool
can also use the Breathe Stormlight, Enhance, and
Regenerate actions from chapter 5 of the _Stormlight
Handbook_ (though Fused and Regal characters breathe
Voidlight from their infused spheres, not Stormlight).
**Attacks**
Most adversaries have at least one attack, which lists
the outcome of a graze (if that attack can graze) and a
hit. Some of these serve as the adversary’s basic Strike
action, while others include more powerful effects.
Unless otherwise specified, all adversary attacks are
made against the target’s Physical defense.
Unlike PC weapons—which have specific tags like
Two-Handed—an adversary’s weapon name is merely
descriptive and doesn’t invoke any special rules. It’s
up to you to decide how an adversary’s attacks work
within the story; for example, attacks that list a reach
are generally melee attacks, while attacks that list a
range are ranged. You can limit these attacks when
it makes sense to do so; in general, err on the side of
creating dynamic scenes that challenge the PCs.
**Damage**
Actions that deal damage include two options for
determining damage: a single number, followed by
parentheses with a formula for rolling dice. For example,
if an attack deals “8 (1d4 + 6) keen damage,” you
can deal 8 damage, or you can roll a d4 then add 6
to the result.
Use the first number if you want to quickly deal
damage without calculating the roll result; this number
provides the average damage dealt by that die roll. Use
the formula if you prefer the drama or unpredictability
of rolling dice for damage.
**Reactive Strikes**
Adversaries can use the Reactive Strike reaction
like PCs, spending 1 focus to attack when an enemy
voluntarily leaves their reach. The adversary can make
this attack using any attack action that costs and that
lists a reach, but not one with only a range listed.
**346** Chapter 13: Gamemastering

```
If an adversary rolls a Complication (or a PC rolls an
Opportunity), allow the players to suggest how that
unfolds. Consider the following ideas:
```

◆ (^) The adversary or their ally gains a disadvantage
on their next test.
◆ (^) The adversary loses 1 focus.
◆ (^) The adversary suffers a condition until the end of
their next turn.
◆ (^) The narrative shifts slightly in the party’s favor.

###### Building Combat Scenes

```
Conversations and endeavors are paced by the needs of
the plot, and these more free-form scenes are easier to
improvise and change. By contrast, combat scenes can
be trickier to plan right; combat relies on a lot of the
math behind the system, and it can be tricky to create
combats that are fun and provide the right level of
challenge for your players.
Published adventures present combat scenes built
specifically for that story and the party’s expected level,
but when you want to create your own combats using the
adversary profiles found in an adventure or the Storm-
light World Guide , this section guides you in balancing
them against your party’s level and combat ability.
```

```
Determining Tier of Play
As the PCs level up, they become stronger and neces-
sitate greater trials to challenge them. Each adversary
is categorized into one of the tiers of play (1–4); these
correspond to the party’s tier, as listed in the “Character
Advancement” section at the end of chapter 1.
An adversary’s tier indicates the ideal levels they
were designed to be fought at. However, adversaries can
be used in higher and lower tiers to create unique and
unexpected combats for the party (see the “Choosing
Adversaries” section for guidelines).
```

```
Deciding Scene Difficulty
Before selecting adversaries for a scene, decide how
much of a challenge you want it to pose. Is this a
dangerous battle after which the characters should
take time to recuperate, or is it just a quick scuffle on
their way across the city? Your answer will affect how
many adversaries you choose—and what kind.
Combat difficulty is determined by the threat
of adversaries relative to the number of player
characters in the combat. Each adversary has a
threat value based on their role; as described
in the next section, when you choose
adversaries for your scene, their threat
values added together should roughly
```

```
match the total threat you want the scene to pose
to the characters.
The following benchmarks offer a starting point
to judge the difficulty of a combat:
Easy combats have a total threat equaling half the
number of PCs in the party. For example, if you have
four players, an easy scene’s total threat is 2. The party
can navigate these scenes without much difficulty.
Average combats have a total threat equaling the
number of PCs in the party. For example, if you have
four players, a medium combat’s total threat is 4.
The party might need a long rest after two to three
of these combats.
Hard combats have a total threat equaling one and a half
times the number of PCs in the party. For example,
if you have four players, a hard combat’s total threat
is 6. The party likely can’t handle more than one of
these between long rests.
```

```

Scaling Threat
An adversary’s threat value assumes the adversary
and the characters are in the same tier of play (see
“Determining Tier of Play”). You can use the Scaling
Adversary Threats table to convert threat values, or you
can calculate it yourself: If an adversary is of a higher
tier than the PCs, double the threat value for each tier
above them. If an adversary is of a lower tier than the
PCs, divide the threat value by half for each tier above
them, rounding to the nearest quarter.
For example, if your party is tier 1, a tier 2 Rival
adversary has a threat value of 2. If your party is tier 2,
that same adversary has a threat value of 1. If your party
is tier 3, that same adversary has a threat value of 0.5.

1 tier higher than adversary 0.25 0.5 2
2 tiers higher than adversary 0 0.25 1
3 tiers higher than adversary 0 0 0.5
```

```
Adjusting Adversary Health
After deciding on your scene difficulty and choosing
adversaries, you might like to tweak the combat further
(such as when compensating for a party optimized
for combat). An easy way to do this is by adjusting an
adversary’s health. Lower health helps weak parties
maintain momentum, while higher health makes
adversaries last longer so strong characters can make
the most of their abilities.
Each adversary profile includes both a fixed health
value and a wider health range, such as “60 (48–72).”
You can use this range to adjust the health of individual
adversaries or groups, fine-tuning their difficulty against
the party or add variety between similar adversaries.
```

```
An Average Party
The threat values of adversaries assume that the party
has a mix of strengths, with some PCs who excel in com-
bat and others who shine in non-combat scenes. If most
of the PCs are optimized for combat (or their players are
particularly strategic), you may need to raise the total
threat of combat scenes. If most of the PCs are stronger
out of combat (or their players don’t prioritize strategy in
combat), you may need to lower the total threat instead.
```

```
Power Spikes
Adversaries are ranked by tier, but within each tier of
play, the PCs are weaker as they enter it and stronger
right before they move to the next tier. Other factors
can also dramatically increase the combat power of
player characters, such as Shardblades and additional
attack actions (like the Devastating Blow talent).
Consider these spikes in damage when determining
what difficulty of combat will challenge the party;
you might need more adversaries to do so.
```

```
Choosing Adversaries
As described in “Using Adversaries,” each adversary has
a role indicating their overall complexity and assigning
them certain special rules. This role also determines the
threat value each enemy adds to a combat:
Minion (0.5 threat). A Minion adversary has a threat
value equal to half a PC. They have low health and
can’t critically hit with attacks.
Rival (1 threat). A Rival adversary has a threat value
equal to one PC. They have no extra rules associated
with their stat block.
Boss (4 threat). A Boss adversary has a threat value
equal to four PCs. They can take both a slow turn and
a fast turn each round of combat, and they can spend
focus to take additional actions or cure themselves of
conditions.
The above threat values only apply to the tier of play
the adversary is designed for; see “Scaling Threat”
for adjusting threat between tiers.
Calculating Total Threat
Once you know your desired combat difficulty (see
“Deciding Scene Difficulty”), add adversaries to your
combat until the sum of their threat values matches
your desired total threat. For example, if you’re
planning a hard combat for four players, you need
a total threat of 6. You could reach that threat with
one Boss adversary plus two Rival adversaries, or with
four Rival adversaries plus four Minion adversaries,
or with similar combinations.

Adding Variety

to Combat Scenes

Due to their many moving parts and heavy use of
precise rules, combat scenes take the most real-world
time to play each minute of “in-game” time. To keep
your game’s momentum, use combats judiciously, and
when they do appear, strive to make each feel a bit
unique and different. Here are a few suggestions.

Vary Terrain
Add in changes in elevation, start the PCs at different
distances from the enemies, and/or add in dangerous or
difficult terrain. The same enemies in different positions
or on a different battlefield can make for an entirely
different combat.

Consider the Previous Scene
The scene that led to the combat can often change
how the combat begins. A failed negotiation may result
in the PCs coming into the combat with low focus,
or an ambush late at night might result in the PCs
not having their gear ready. Think of what led up to
the combat scene and how you can reflect that in the
starting conditions.

Provide Non-Combat Objectives
If a fight’s purpose is only to kill the enemy, it’ll be a
fairly single-minded affair. But most combat happens
as part of a larger story, with both sides attempting
to accomplish something beyond just killing their
opponent. They might be trying to race to a gemheart,
rescue a hostage, perform a spectacular duel, or capture
a fleeing target. Regardless of their objective, maneuver
tactically to force the PCs to choose between fighting
and pursuing their objective, creating interesting and
hard choices for them.

Offer Resources and Opportunities
You can litter the battlefield with resources that inven-
tive PCs can use to get an edge in combat: precariously
perched boulders ready to be toppled, spheres of
Storm light sitting nearby, or volatile explosives sitting
in the open. Creative players might find ways to use
these without any prompting, but if nobody takes the
bait, you can encourage players to spend Opportunities
in ways that feature these resources.

Mix and Match Enemies
Adversary profiles are designed with abilities that can
complement and synergize with each other. By mixing
and matching the different enemy types, you can
challenge the PCs in new ways.

```
Challenging Radiants
Radiant characters have access to powerful surges
and healing. This can make it hard for the GM to plan
meaningful challenges when high-level characters can just
melt the walls or step into Shadesmar. It’s even harder to
make someone who safely can take a sword to the head
feel threatened. Luckily, there are tools scattered across
Roshar that can help. Use these in your stories when
you need moments that really challenge the Radiants
and make them reconsider how often they use or show
their powers.
Certain enemy profiles in published adventures or the
Stormlight World Guide have specific rules for some of
these tools, but for your own stories, implement them
however works for you.
White Sand. People from offworld (or with connections
to the Ghostbloods) may have access to white sand.
This strange substance is usually a deep black, but when
exposed to Investiture, it turns white. This can detect the
presence of Radiant powers when the PCs might prefer
to stay hidden.
Secretspren. The Fused have access to a strange bright
yellow spren that can detect the use of Investiture. When
detected, these spren fly screaming toward the source,
revealing it to dangerous threats like the Fused.
Raysium. Weapons inlaid with raysium (the God Metal
of Odium) can draw Stormlight out of a target. When
someone is hit or grazed by attacks made with raysium
weapons, they can lose some of their Investiture, quickly
draining their supply and depriving them of Stormlight.
Larkin. Larkin (and some hordelings bred from them)
drain and feast on Stormlight. When they get close to
Radiants, larkin can pull all the Investiture out of the
Radiant’s body and spheres.
Anti-Stormlight. Potentially the most dangerous,
anti-Stormlight has a violent, combustive effect when it
comes into contact with Stormlight. Gems holding this
light can be mounted on large arrows or other weapons
and used to kill Radiants ... and even Radiant spren.
The Weeping. The end of each year is marked by a four-
week-long period with steady rainfall, but no highstorms—
and thus no Stormlight. During these periods, Radiants
need to carefully conserve their Stormlight or risk not
being able to use their powers.
```

```
Chapter 13: Gamemastering 349
```

###### Adventures

```
Each self-contained story within your campaign is
an adventure. Some adventures are brief one-shot
scenarios that unfold in a single session. Other adven-
tures consist of several chapters, each requiring several
sessions to complete.
Every adventure needs a clear beginning, middle,
and end. It should lead with an engaging hook, offer
multiple challenges to overcome, and drive toward
a climactic conclusion. No adventure should be
“railroaded” or set in stone, but good preparation can
lead to great improvisation. So while you can plan as
much of the story as you wish, remember that players’
ideas and narrative choices should always influence the
story’s outcome.
A published adventure can provide helpful structure,
especially for a GM who’s busy or less experienced.
Other GMs prefer to modify official scenarios or design
their own homebrew adventures (see below).
```

```
Published Adventures
To begin your Cosmere RPG journey, consider playing
an official published adventure. These contain original
lore, prewritten scenarios, maps, and adversaries; with
these resources, you can reduce preparation time and
focus on running the game. The following adventures
are specifically designed for new players:
Bridge Nine is an introductory 1st-level adventure that
includes six pregenerated characters. It introduces
GMs to the Cosmere RPG rules and players to the
Stormlight setting.
The First Step is a session zero adventure and
Cosmere RPG tutorial. A unique alternative to
traditional character-building, this adventure allows
players to begin as “level 0” characters, defining their
abilities and backstory through play. The First Step
ties directly into the Stonewalkers adventure.
Stonewalkers is an adventure path that takes characters
from level 1 through 8. Written in close collaboration
with Brandon Sanderson and Dan Wells, this advent-
ure gives characters the chance to play a pivotal role
in Roshar’s history as the True Desolation begins and
the Lost Radiants return.
You don’t have to play a published adventure in its
entirety to glean value from it. Perhaps you use it as
the jumping-off point for a campaign that moves in
another direction, or you shift the plot to better match
your characters’ goals and obstacles. Maybe it contains
helpful scenes, maps, or adversaries that you can lift and
place into your own homebrew adventure. No matter
how you use one of these adventures, it can provide
```

```
valuable inspiration and a greater understanding
of Roshar.
```

```
Your Own Adventures
Designing your own adventures is a rewarding way to
step into the world of Roshar and exercise your own
creativity. Often known as “homebrew” adventures,
these are often the best way to create a narrative that
empowers the players by tying into their characters’
specific goals, purpose, and obstacles. The Cosmere
RPG has been designed to support home brew advent-
ures as the default mode of play, with guidelines for
building scenes of every type.
If you’re creating homebrew Stormlight content,
you should also have a copy of the Stormlight World
Guide , which includes profiles for a wide range of
adversaries.
```

**350** Chapter 13: Gamemastering

```
Tens of Thousands. The grand battles for the fate of
Roshar play out on massive fields with soldiers as far
as the eye can see. In conflicts with tens of thousands
of troops, only incredibly powerful characters are
likely to play a key role, such as Shardbearers and
Radiants of tier 3 or higher.
Time
A battle’s total time can often change depending on
choices made during the conflict, but it’s good to have
a sense of how much time you expect the battle to
take up in your story. Quicker battles are good for a
rush of excitement, while longer battles could end up
dominating a large chunk of an adventure. Consider
how long your battle should last:
Minutes. Some smaller or vicious battles can be
resolved in a matter of minutes. In these situations,
the PCs will likely face only a few scenes before the
battle runs its course.
Hours. Most battles play out over the course of hours.
Across this time, the PCs play out many different
scenes with varying objectives, twists, and turns as
the battle’s events unfold. 
Days. Sieges of defended positions and massive battles
across multiple fronts can often stretch into days and
more. These battles likely include not only scenes,
but also long rests and other breaks from the action
so the PCs can recuperate. 
```

```
The Party’s Role
The PCs might have a central role in the battle and
its outcome, or they could be lower-ranking troops in
charge of a specific area or task; either approach creates
memorable stories. Consider the following roles the
party might fill in the conflict:
Caught in the Fray. The PCs could be simple foot
soldiers or hangers-on in a larger conflict. During
this battle, they’ll likely focus on survival or on
accomplishing one small objective. 
Lynchpin Soldiers. The PCs could be tasked with
key missions important to the battle’s success.
While not in charge themselves, they are responsible
for achieving objectives that determine the
battle’s outcome. 
Commanders. The PCs could be in charge of some
(or even all) of the troops on the field. They not only
need to wade into the battle themselves, but also
determine strategy and tactics for the battle. 
```

###### Mass Warfare

```
War is ever-present on Roshar, and thus it often plays
a major part in adventures and greater campaigns. It’s
likely that your group will find themselves embroiled in
a larger battle at some point during their adventures. 
Battles are complex, chaotic, and messy things. They
can stretch for hours, if not days. From the perspective
of a small party, it can be nearly impossible to see the
entire scope of a battle unfold. The best each person
can do is try to contribute in their own way and hope
that it can help sway the overall flow of the battle. 
Due to this size and complexity, massive battles
aren’t run as a combat or other single scene type.
Instead, battles serve more as a setting for an entire
arc of an adventure, unfolding over the course of
multiple scenes chained together. Each of these scenes
advances the larger story of the conflict progressing and
the party’s involvement in it. The PCs might start with
a conversation with a commander discussing the plans
for the battle, move on to an endeavor sneaking behind
enemy lines, stumble into a scene when they are caught
by enemy combatants, then progress to a conversation
as those combatants surrender. And all of this might
only comprise a small portion of the overall battle.
This section gives guidance for how to structure
the different scenes of a battle and to determine
how the battle changes around your group as they
contribute to it.
```

```
Defining the Scope of a Battle 
When running a battle as part of your adventure, first
define the battle’s scope, as this can change how you
might want to structure it. Important factors include
the number of troops involved in the battle, the time
the battle will take, and the party’s role in the conflict.
Number of Troops
The number of soldiers involved in the conflict plays
an enormous role in the feel of a battle. The larger the
conflict, the longer it’ll take and the harder it’ll be for
the PCs to play a key part, but the overall battle itself is
likely to feel pivotal. Consider how many troops are in
your battle:
Hundreds. Smaller battles are likely to be border
skirmishes or covert operations. With only a few
hundred soldiers, it’s easy for even tier 1 PCs to have
a large impact on these battles. 
Thousands. As armies grow into the thousands, the
action starts playing out on multiple fronts. Tier 2
characters can play a pivotal role in these conflicts,
but they’ll only be part of a bigger picture.

Battle Phases
During a battle, gameplay takes the form of sequential
scenes that represent the group’s involvement in
the conflict. To organize these scenes in an easy-to-
understand way, divide the battle into phases. Each
phase of the battle comprises multiple scenes and
represents a single objective for the party’s side of the
conflict. Once that objective succeeds or fails, the
battle proceeds to the next phase, which likely varies
depending on the previous phase’s outcome.
What each phase represents and how one phase
leads into another depends on the story you want to tell
with a battle. A phase might involve one side trying to
place bridges over a chasm while the other tries to stop
them, or it might call for retreating from a losing battle
without suffering catastrophic losses. Try to map out
your different battle phases ahead of time, then consider
how success or failure would change the next phase
of the battle. As you play through phases, think about
what each side is trying to accomplish and how they
react to these different twists and turns. Also consider
how the PCs might be involved in each phase given
the role they’re playing in this battle.
Based on the party’s role in a given phase of the
battle, their actions might determine when it ends, or
the phase might conclude entirely independently of what
the PCs are doing. If playing a key role, the phase won’t
end until the PCs succeed or fail (or until an outside
factor overrides their efforts). If their goals aren’t critical
to the phase, however, it might end unceremoniously
in the middle of them trying to accomplish other goals,
swinging the battle in a new direction unexpectedly. 
The Example Battle Phases chart depicts the phases
of a battle between an Alethi highprince’s army and
an army of warform singers over a gemheart on the
Shattered Plains. Here, each phase summarizes what
the armies are trying to accomplish and the party’s role
in it, as well as how success or failure would proceed to
the next phase of the battle. 
```

```
Events in Battle
During a battle, action surrounds the PCs. The ebbs
and flows of battle, along with the choices of other
characters on the battlefield, can have a large impact on
the party’s plans. To help tangibly represent this during
play, you can use events (see “Events” in chapter 9) to
represent both positive and negative highlights of battle.
A Complication event could represent the enemy’s
```

```
progress toward laying down bridges across a chasm,
while an Opportunity event could represent your troops’
progress on cutting out a gemheart to win the day. 
Try to have at least one event going at any given
time. You can start them for a variety of reasons. Maybe
the party’s actions in a previous scene triggered the
countdown, perhaps by calling for reinforcements or
being spotted by an enemy patrol that now closes in.
Alternatively, events could show the machinations of
characters outside of the party’s awareness, such as an
enemy commander executing a plan or a highstorm
bearing down on the battlefield. 
```

```
Scenes in Battle
The actual scenes your PCs play out during each phase
depends on their role in the conflict and how they want
to contribute. At the start of each phase, make sure the
PCs are aware of how the battle is shifting and what the
new objectives are (or at least, as aware as they would be
in the chaos of battle). Then, ask them what they want to
do in this new phase. This choice determines the kinds
of scenes that you’ll play out. These can encompass
nearly anything, but consider the following scenes:
Scouting. Scouting, spying, and other endeavors to
perform reconnaissance can gather information for
the commanders of the army. The PCs could discover
enemy strategies, spot weaknesses in fortifications, or
even decipher a coded message between enemies.
Command. Higher-tier PCs might be placed in charge
of allied soldiers. These scenes can take the form of
an endeavor that focuses on planning strategies and
tactics, or they might be conversations to issue orders
and inspire their soldiers.
Take Ground. Much of warfare centers around taking
and holding ground or various objectives. You can
reflect this combat against enemy combatants many
times in battle scenes. See the upcoming “In the Fray”
section for guidance on making these combats feel like
they take place in the chaos of a battle. 
Rescue. Even if the stakes of the larger battle are out of
the party’s control, they have much more impact on
the lives of their friends and allies. Even as the larger
battle flounders, key scenes can focus on endeavors to
race across the battlefield to save an endangered ally,
or on combats to protect allies. 
Retreat. Even if all hope is lost, the PCs still need to
get to safety. Endeavors to flee from the opponent
or conversations to bargain for safety both might be
critical to survival at this stage.

How Scenes Affect the Battle
An individual scene’s outcome often impacts the battle
as a whole, depending on the party’s role in the battle
and how their personal objective compares to the overall
objective of the current phase of the battle. If the party’s
objective is critical to the current phase of the battle,
their scene’s outcome could decide when the phase ends
and whether their side is victorious. 
If, instead, the PCs are pursuing objectives
independent of the current phase of the battle—such
as rescuing an ally or hunting down a rival among the
enemy’s ranks—the outcome of their scenes may have

```
little to no impact on the current battle itself (though
it may still have a large impact on the wider story).
If you want to reflect the party’s impact on the battle
even when they aren’t directly pursuing the main
objective, consider adding events to future scenes based
on the success or failure of their past scenes. After
negotiating medical support in a previous scene, this
might manifest in a combat event you call “Surgeons
on the Way.” Similarly, if the party failed an endeavor
and a building was set on fire, this might cause all
nearby combatants to become Disoriented due to the
overwhelming smoke.

Chapter 13: Gamemastering **353**

In the Fray
Many scenes (especially combats) during a larger
battle take place amidst hundreds of other characters
fighting for their lives. The PCs should constantly feel
the presence of this dangerous chaos all around them.
Rather than depicting and tracking enough individual
characters to capture this feeling—which is entirely
impractical in a large battle—you’re encouraged to
represent the surrounding chaos through the narrative.
Give the party regular updates on the surrounding
battle and use it to set the boundaries and obstacles of a
scene. Instead of walls defining the edges of a combat,
the PCs might be limited by other groups of soldiers
that are too packed together to move safely past.
In addition to these more passive tools, consider the
following active tools to bring the feeling of the battle
into scenes:

**Opportunities and Complications.** Opportunities and
Complications are an essential tool in representing
the things happening around the PCs. Raise the stakes
often during large battles, and use the Opportunities
and Complications rolled to show the effects of
the battle all around. The impact of plot die results

```
should be at their most dramatic during warfare.
A Complication could cause a hail of arrows to
rain down on an entire platoon of soldiers, cause
a nearby enemy to rush over and join combat, or
cause an important ally to be pulled away by the
pressing bodies on all sides. On the other hand, an
Opportunity could cause a nearby front to push
forward, cause a runner to appear with news from
command, or cause an enemy to flee in search of
easier opponents elsewhere on the battlefield. 
Events. As discussed earlier in “Events in Battle,” events
are a powerful tool to show the longer-term ebb and
flow of other parts of the battle. For example, an
event could represent a battle front pushing closer
and threatening to engulf the PCs, or it could lead
to an allied Shardbearer coming to the rescue. 
Tests. Allow creative uses of skill tests by the PCs to
interact with the surrounding battle. One character
might want to use Leadership to rally nearby NPCs to
their aid, and another might want to use Intimidation
to scare back an enemy front to clear more room.
Encourage these uses and invite new ways for the
PCs to feel like they’re impacting the battle around
themselves.
```

```
die, some might retire, or others might depart from
the group for other reasons. If an ongoing player in your
group has their character leave the group for one of
these reasons, you can have them create a new character
matching the current level of the group, as described
later in “Starting at Higher Levels.” However, during
longer campaigns, it’s also totally normal to have players
come and go. You can add new players to the group or
have players “guest star” for a few sessions.
```

###### Awarding Advancement

```
As the player characters progress through the story, they
grow, learn, and gain allies. Mechanically, this takes the
form of gaining levels (see “Character Advancement”
in chapter 1) and rewards (see “Rewards” in chapter 8).
The primary rules for those are in the corresponding
chapters, but this section offers additional guidance on
when and how often to grant them to players. It’s your
job to decide how to spread out levels and rewards, thus
shaping the pace and feel of your campaign.
```

```
Levels
Levels represent the party accumulating experience
with their abilities through consistent practice. As such,
levels should be paced at fairly even intervals throughout
your campaign.
It’s good to award levels at momentous and satisfying
moments. Choose a time where the party has reached a
meaningful story milestone or has proven their abilities
through much hardship. At these times, the level
feels well-earned and satisfying, imbuing the party’s
progression with meaning and purpose.
Matching Levels
Unless there’s a significant story reason for one character
to be a different level than the others, you’re encouraged
to keep all PCs in the group at the same level. Even if
a character misses a few sessions, they can just level up
when they get back.
```

```
Level Frequency
Exactly how often to grant your PCs levels depends
on your campaign and its story. Since each tier of play
represents a different type of story and experience, it’s
important that you pace your character levels to align
their power with what you want them accomplishing in
the story. (See “Character Advancement” in chapter 1
for guidance on what to expect at each tier.) If your story
isn’t ready to move onto a more epic scale, it’s probably
wise to keep character progression slow and steady.
```

```
Battle Outcomes
At a certain point, the outcome of the battle becomes
clear. One side is retreating, surrendering, or has
otherwise been outmaneuvered and outplayed. As the
final phase of the battle comes to an end, make sure the
PCs are aware of how things concluded (unless there is
some reason they wouldn’t be aware). Following that,
an opportunity for a long rest or longer downtime can
often be a good time to give the PCs a break.
```

###### Structuring a Campaign

```
A campaign follows the same group across many
adventures. By linking these together, players can watch
their characters grow from lowly scribes and soldiers
into Knights Radiants and heroes of Roshar, eventually
becoming worldhopping adventurers of the entire cos-
mere. Depending on how you want to align the party’s
story relative to the unfolding story of the Stormlight
Archive novels, one adventure might roll right into
another with no breaks, or you might grant some
downtime between story arcs. When the latter happens,
use the downtime rules from chapter 9 to discuss what
each character might be up to between adventures.
During a longer campaign, some players may play the
same PC across the entire story, while other PCs might
only join for part of the story. Some characters might
```

```
Character Death
In the constant turmoil of war, death is a common part of
stories on Roshar. Even after characters gain the powerful
healing abilities of Stormlight, certain threats can still
overcome their incredible survival abilities, as described in
“Damage, Injury, and Death” in chapter 9.
It’s okay for certain stories to end with a PC dying, but
it’s important that players feel like they have agency in
what happens to their character. When a PC drops to 0
health, they become Unconscious and suffer an injury.
However, as described in the Unconscious condition,
enemies should usually ignore downed PCs (unless it fits
the story for them to do otherwise), and the player gets to
decide when their PC becomes conscious again.
As a result, a PC is only likely to die if they repeatedly get
back up multiple times after falling, rather than remaining
Unconscious. Make sure the player is aware that they
are risking death by doing so. Dying for a cause (or for
any reason fitting the character’s story) can create an
incredibly satisfying conclusion to a character’s arc, but
the player should be part of the storytelling experience.
```

```
Chapter 13: Gamemastering 355
```

KEVIN SIDHARTA

```
Published adventures provide recommendations
on character level and when to grant additional levels.
However, when running your own campaign, consider
the full arc of the story and ask yourself the following
two questions to set your leveling pace:
```

◆ (^) How many sessions do you expect each part of the
story to take?
◆ (^) During those parts of the story, which tier of play
do you want the players to experience?
For example, if you expect to spend about four sessions
with tier 1 characters fighting on the Shattered Plains,
followed by about 6 sessions of gaining and growing their
Radiant powers, you want them to pass through two full
tiers of play (10 levels) in about 10 sessions. This means
you’d want to grant around 1 level per session.
On the other hand, if you expect to have a longer-
running campaign that’ll require a dozen sessions before
the characters even have the potential to bond spren,
you likely want to grant a level only every 2–3 sessions.
Rewards
While levels advance relatively linearly, rewards are a
dynamic form of advancement that you can grant to
players based on the narrative and their character’s
personal accomplishments. A reward can be anything
of power or value that the characters gain through
pursuing their goals. While most rewards are gained
when characters accomplish their personal goals, you
can also grant rewards at meaningful story moments
that warrant them.
Chapter 8 describes goals and rewards from a
player’s perspective, but this section provides additional
guidance on how and when to grant, advance, and
finish goals.
Granting Goals
When a player comes to you with an idea for a new goal
for their character, work with them to ensure that it’s
a good match for your story, their tier, and the scope
of a goal.
For your story, think about what you plan on having
the PCs accomplish in the coming session. Is this goal
reachable? Does it feel appropriate and in line with
their other actions and motivations? If not, try to offer
suggestions that might stay in the same vein, but align
with your plans.
For the tier, think of a suitable reward, and consider
what tier you think the PCs will be in after the goal
is completed. Is that reward appropriate for that tier?
If it’s too powerful, consider encouraging the PC to
work toward an intermediate step instead.
Finally for the scope, think about how long it might
take the character to accomplish this goal. If that
timeline would stretch far beyond several sessions,
it’s a good idea to work with the player to subdivide
it into smaller goals.
Advancing Goals
Make sure to regularly check in on PC goals and ensure
the players are getting opportunities to advance them.
The end of the session is a good time to touch base
with each player and see if they feel like their character
made meaningful progress on their goal during that
session. If they did, awarding one milestone checkbox
is appropriate. In moments of great accomplishment,
you can grant two points if it feels appropriate. In this
way, most goals will take 2–3 sessions to complete when
actively pursuing them (or much longer if a character
isn’t making meaningful progress).
Keep in mind that when it comes to the story,
not every goal can necessarily be finished quickly;
a monumental task could take far more than just
3 sessions to complete. In these cases, you can give
out advancements much slower—or, as mentioned
earlier, work with the player to reevaluate the goal
and divide it into subtasks.
Finishing Goals
When a character checks all three milestone boxes
and finishes their goal, it’s time to grant them a reward!
Most goals have a clear and obvious reward, such as
“win a Shardblade in a duel.” But others might be
more ambiguous, or the obvious reward might not be
something you want a PC to have access to for other
story reasons.
Keep in mind that the reward you grant doesn’t
always have to be the thing the character was seeking.
Often, it’s appropriate to grant a character not what they
wanted, but what they needed instead; but regardless
of what the character wants, be careful that their player
will be happy with the reward. For example, a character
might be cheated out of winning a Shardblade due to
a technicality in Alethi tradition, but they may have
earned a powerful highlord as a patron for showing
honor in the face of this treachery.
**356** Chapter 13: Gamemastering

###### Starting at Higher Levels

```
Not every adventure begins with the characters at
a low power level. If the story you want to tell starts
with the characters as Radiants or similarly powerful
adventurers, it’s appropriate to start your campaign
at a higher level. These campaigns often start at the
beginning of a tier (level 6, 11, or 16), but as GM, you
can choose any starting level you want.
When starting a campaign at a higher level, provide
your players the following instructions for character
creation, which supplement the instructions in
chapter 1.
Also be sure to inform them of anything else
you want their characters to have, such as choosing
equipment or creating details from their backstory. A
higher-level character often has experiences from their
past adventures, so it can be appropriate for you to seed
different story hooks or connections based on what
happened before your shared story begins.
```

```
Higher-Level
Character Creation
These character-building options are only available to
players with GM permission, as most campaigns start at
level 1. Your GM may give you these instructions if they
want your game to start at a higher level, if your previous
character died, or if you’re joining an existing group
with higher-level characters (in which case, the GM will
probably have you create a new character at the same
level as the other PCs).
Create and Level Up the Character
First follow the character creation instructions as if
you were creating a 1st-level character, then make the
choices for each level sequentially (assigning attributes,
increasing health, and so on).
```

```
Choose Rewards and Items
In addition to the normal choices from character
creation and advancement, your higher-level character
will have acquired certain items and rewards for their
actions and adventures so far in life. Use the Higher-
Level Starting Rewards table to determine how many
marks you gain (which you can use to buy items), as well
as how many rewards you can choose from chapter 8.
Work with the GM on choosing your rewards. This
helps you make sure it’s a good fit for the upcoming
campaign’s narrative, and the GM can help you weave
a story of how your character received it.

###### Canon and Continuity

```
The Stormlight Archive provides a vast wealth of
information and resources for roleplayers to incorporate
into their games. Singers, spren, highstorms, Storm-
light, and Surgebinding are fundamental to the setting
of Roshar. However, while knowing the particulars
of different rockbud varieties or a culture’s unique
greeting can add flavor, these details aren’t essential
to good gameplay.
```

```
Evoking Roshar
When roleplaying on Roshar, it’s often the small
touches that have the biggest impact on immersing
you in the world. For example, the GM and players
can narrate singer characters humming to rhythms
(see “Singer Ancestry” in chapter 2) when they need
to convey emotions, describe the flora retracting at a
character’s approach, and detail the spren that appear
around the characters.
Spren
Spren are nearly omnipresent on Roshar and can appear
at displays of strong emotions or alongside the natural
elements of the world. Chapter 5 details the Radiant
spren, but the Spren Types table lists common “lesser
spren” you can sprinkle into your storytelling.
```

```
Continuity
When planning adventures, think about the era and
specific timeline of your campaign, then use current
events to add context and momentum throughout the
campaign. Consider major developments for the singers
and their forms, the Knights Radiant, the forces of
Odium, international affairs, enemy occupations, and
fabrial science during that timeline. However, just
because something happened in the novels doesn’t
mean it has to happen in your game the same way—
you can change the future (or even Roshar’s history)
to suit the story your group wants to explore.
```

```
Your Roshar
Before your group begins playing, discuss how closely
everyone wants the game to follow canon. Feel free to
explore your own personal version of Roshar around
your table, giving you and your group infinite potential
to shape the future of Roshar. Some groups may wish to
be unfettered by continuity, allowing their campaign to
unfold in unexpected ways. This could be as dramatic
as replacing the protagonists of the books with your
group’s player characters, or as subtle as adjusting the
timing and particulars of existing canon events.
```

Reward Prerequisites
Some talents or other aspects of character advancement
might have prerequisites related to rewards. As you work
your way through each level of character advancement,
assume that you gained each reward during the first
level of its tier.
Swearing a Radiant Ideal counts as a reward, so
you can’t choose higher-tier Radiant talents unless you
first spend a reward on each earlier Ideal sworn. For
example, if you’re creating a tier 3 character and want
to play a Truthwatcher of the Third Ideal, you’ll have to
spend both of your tier 1 rewards and your tier 2 reward
on the rewards for those three Ideals, leaving only one
tier 3 reward for you to allocate elsewhere.
Heroic characters who don’t wish to or are narratively
unable to bond a spren tend to establish their increased
power through gaining powerful gear, companions,
patrons, and titles as rewards.

```
ARI IBARRA
```

While this play style gives the players more freedom,
be aware that it could cause your game to diverge from
future events in the Stormlight Archive. Reshaping the
future can create fascinating stories, but if you don’t
want to worry about diverging from the novels, you
might instead create a campaign set in the distant past
of Roshar during the cycle of Desolations. Your party of
heroes could be the greatest heroes of their generation,
interacting with the Heralds and setting the course of
history. While there’ll be fewer official resources for
this era, that allows ample opportunities for creative
world-building.
Regardless of which part of the timeline your game
is set in, make sure trivia and corrections never over-
shadow gameplay. Some players may find it rewarding
to consult an online wiki to help adjudicate the results
of a Lore test, while others may prefer to improvise
an answer and keep the game moving. Discussing
everyone’s preferences ahead of time can keep your
game running smoothly.

Canon Roshar
The default setting for Stormlight campaigns spans
the first five novels in the series. The first book,
The Way of Kings, shows the state of the world as the
Era of Solitude comes to an end. During the second
book, Words of Radiance , the Everstorm arrives and
the True Desolation begins.
Most groups seek to play a game that largely
integrates with the canonical story, allowing the
world to change and grow alongside future novels and
novellas. Roshar is a large and populous world, allowing
for many important stories to coexist! It’s also a time
when profound changes to society have shaken societal
traditions, facilitating a diverse range of character
options and cultural interactions.
Perhaps your characters are members of the
refounded Knights Radiant, taking direction from
Dalinar or Navani and fighting beside heroes like
Kaladin. Alternatively, your group could be operating in
the shadows to thwart the Ghostbloods or another secret
society, or you might be a group of listeners working to
free other singers from Odium’s control. Whether your
characters are headquartered in Urithiru or fighting
behind enemy lines in Rall Elorim, the True Desolation
era offers many opportunities for heroism and adventure.
If playing a canonical campaign, refer to resources
like the ones mentioned in the “Next Steps” section
at the end of this book. If not everyone has read and
finished the series, that’s fine—as long as they’re
okay with spoilers that may arise. The group can
work together to recall and contribute details
during gameplay.
```

```
New Players and Canon
A player who’s completely unfamiliar with the books
might choose to play as a worldhopper or someone from
a remote part of Roshar, so they can learn about their
world along with their character. Alternatively, a new
player can read the “Welcome to Roshar” guide found
on  CosmereRPG.com ; this provides an easy-to-read
overview of what a typical person from Eastern Roshar
would know about the world.
```

```
A Note on GM Style
The GM might walk their players through the world
of Roshar as a tour guide, sharing immersive lore when
relevant. Or the GM might gloss over world-building details
in favor of keeping the setting more accessible to newcom-
ers or to move the plot along at a brisk pace. Every GM is
different, and both styles are valid. Ultimately, the focus is
on telling a great story and building a great adventure with
friends around the table!

###### Safety Guide

```
Roleplaying creates a strange type of magic. We get
to play pretend, experiment, relieve stress, and belong
to something special. In RPGs, the concept of safety
centers around the comfort, acknowledgment, and
space everyone at the table shares. Most people want
to be considerate and collaborative during gameplay.
The tools and tips in this section are rooted in common
courtesy and customized to address delicate facets
of games set in Roshar.
```

```
Using Safety Tools
Each group uses safety tools differently. Some prefer
formal tools and processes such as conducting a session
zero before a campaign begins, while others rely more
```

```
on informal conversations. The tools in this guide
encourage comfortable and fair gameplay, but as with
everything in this book, the GM and players can adapt
these principles and combine them with additional
tools as needed. While proactive measures help prevent
problems, at times, intentional reactive aid is needed too
(see “Checking In”). It’s best to think of safety tools as
evolving resources that continue stretching to meet the
needs of everyone at the table.
If you’d like to explore additional resources beyond
those in this guide, you can access a wealth of free safety
tools at TTRPGSafetyToolkit.com. The TTRPG Safety
Toolkit is an online compilation designed by members
of the tabletop roleplaying community for use by players
and GMs at the table; it is co-curated by Kienna Shaw
and Lauren Bryant-Monk.
```

## A Note From Brandon

```
In my books, I tell stories about worlds as flawed as our own.
The Stormlight Archive includes characters and societies who are racist,
classist, sexist, and xenophobic as a way to explore topics of oppression
and marginalization. Showing different perspectives is challenging
enough to do as the author of a novel, whose work can be reviewed
and edited; it’s even trickier to handle in a game, where friends are
improvising their dialogue and actions on the spot.
When it comes to covering difficult topics, I recom mend treating
the other people at your table with trust, sensitivity, and understanding.
Listening is important. One player might want to use roleplaying as
a chance to confront challenging themes, while another sees games as
a chance to take a break from difficult topics. You can decide ahead
of time, as a group, which aspects of the setting to emphasize, which
to handle with care, and which you don’t want to include in your
own campaigns. Discussing players’ preferences ahead of the game
can help make sure everyone at the table has a great experience
telling stories together.
```

**360** Chapter 13: Gamemastering

```
instead. By the beginning of a campaign, the GM and
players should have decided what general themes to
expect during gameplay, along with which to avoid.
The upcoming “Lines and Veils” section can help
in identifying topics to handle with caution, and the
“Topics to Consider” section offers more guidance
on things to be mindful of during play.
What About Canon?
The Stormlight Archive is a manifestation of Brandon
Sanderson’s imagination. His characters and their
stories live in the pages of his books. Now, it’s your
turn. Roshar is the backdrop. What stories will your
group tell? Canon is secondary to creating a story all
players can comfortably enjoy, so shape your Roshar
to fit that story!
A group of like-minded players might have fun
playing in a carbon copy of the Stormlight Archive’s
setting—but enforcing strict canon is only enjoyable
if everyone is on board. Many groups (especially those
with players new to the setting) benefit from a more
laid-back approach; when the GM and players are free
to take liberties with the lore, this can be more fun and
immersive for the group.
For example, the novels don’t focus on which sign
languages are known in Roshar—but that doesn’t mean
they don’t exist. In your Roshar, perhaps sign language
is widely known even by those who don’t rely on it,
allowing a deaf character to communicate easily with
people they encounter.
```

```
Recognize Individual Truth
Games stop being fun when someone’s identity or
trauma is used as a punchline. If someone expresses
discomfort with a topic or scene, this shouldn’t require
a debate about the validity of their concerns—trust
is essential to good roleplaying, and it comes from
acknowledging each other’s truths.
So when someone shares such a truth, there’s no
need to pry or demand explanations. The GM and
players are already forced to confront and address pain
and trauma in their day-to-day lives, and everyone
deserves a reprieve during game time.
```

```
“Truth is individual. Your truth is
what you see. What else could it be?
That is the truth that you spoke to
me, the truth that brings power.”
```

Session Zero

Many groups like to meet before the beginning of
a campaign to plan together. A **session zero** is a
collaborative preliminary game session where everyone
around the table can create characters, discuss setting,
tone and themes, and mutually agree on expectations
for the game. You’re encouraged to cover the following
topics during session zero:

**Campaign Expectations.** Discuss the setting (such
as your chosen timeline and starting location on
Roshar), along with your adventure’s theme and tone.
You might also discuss how dangerous the setting is,
homebrew, house rules, and potentially any foreseen
changes to the novels’ canon. You’ll also want to
decide on your campaign length—is this an ongoing,
long campaign or a short one? This helps the table
manage time commitments and expectations.
**Table Expectations.** Discuss and mutually agree on
table etiquette and how the game is played. How
often will you meet? Approximately how long will
sessions last, and will there be one or more breaks for
refreshment? Are cell phones okay at the table or does
everyone want to keep gameplay free of distractions?
Does everyone feel comfortable with the inclusion
of some mature language and themes, or should the
game be considered “family friendly”?
**Safety Tools.** While a session zero is in itself a safety
tool, it also offers the opportunity to discuss other
tools that can help you navigate any difficulties that
do arise during play. Discuss topics like lines and veils,
boundaries, consent, and conflict resolution strategies.
Also be sure to plan how to handle situations where
someone at the table goes against the guidelines
the table has created together. (The TTRPG Safety
Toolkit linked in “Using Safety Tools” provides
guidance on tools like these.)
**Gameplay Guidance.** Briefly review how gameplay
works and talk through any mechanics questions
your players may have. It may be helpful to create
rules cards or cheat sheets for them to reference key
mechanics easily.
**Character Creation.** While some players may prefer
to create their characters on their own, players can
discuss their character concepts, backstories, and how
their characters fit into the group and the setting.

Identify Fun (and Un-Fun) Topics
Games are about having fun together, so if anyone—
including the GM—is uncomfortable with a topic,
that’s a sign the group should focus on other topics

```
Chapter 13: Gamemastering 361
```

```
Checking In
As you play, be aware of how others are feeling.
If someone seems uncomfortable, ask them if they’re
okay. Create opportunities for people to speak up
and be heard.
```

```
Breaks
Sometimes, gameplay gets tense and emotionally
charged. Other times, we get hungry or need to stretch.
Take a break for a few minutes to refesh your mind and
body—these moments can do wonders for group
engagement.
Reactive Aid
If you realize someone feels uncomfortable with a
situation, address it. “I’m so sorry, I forgot there was
a line there. Let’s backtrack and I’ll approach this
another way.” A quick and sincere apology goes a long
way. When others remind you a topic is off the table,
there’s no need for embarrassment, defensiveness, or
anger. You can simply thank them for the reminder
and adjust accordingly.
By learning to resolve conflicts with respect and
collaboration, you build trust with the people around
you. If you’re not sure how to adjust a scene in an
appropriate way, you can always ask for help. “How
can we approach this instead?” Creative problem-
solving is a pillar of satisfying roleplaying, whether
it’s in character or out of character.
```

```
Lines and Veils
Each person has a different comfort level on various
topics. Talking about “lines” and “veils” can help
everyone communicate which topics the group wants
to completely avoid, and which are okay to allude to
as long as they’re quickly moved past. Nobody should
feel obligated to be comfortable with a particular
topic; people are more important than premises,
and there are plenty of other topics to explore in your
game. (The concept of lines and veils was introduced
in 2004 by the game designer Ron Edwards.)
```

```
Lines
Topics with a line are completely off the table—lines
that shouldn’t be crossed. Topics that someone has
“lined” shouldn’t be acted out, described, alluded
to, or otherwise included in gameplay. For example,
a player might decide that harm to animals is a line;
in this case, animals are never threatened during your
sessions—and beyond that, your group also completely
avoids any implication that animals might be harmed
“off-camera.”
Veils
Topics with a veil take place offscreen, if at all. Some
veiled topics might “fade to black”—an upcoming event
is hinted at, but then the metaphorical camera shifts to
a different scene. Other veiled topics are only hinted at
in past tense, perhaps as part of a backstory or historical
event. Topics that someone veils shouldn’t be talked
about in any specifics, and scenes with those topics
should never be actively played out or central to the
plot of the campaign.
For example, if a player decides that harm to animals
is a veil, they’re comfortable with the story implying
that it happens off-screen. However, the suffering of an
animal shouldn’t be described “on-camera,” and such
themes shouldn’t appear in any scenes.
```

```
Lines and Veils During Play
Even when a group is mindful of each other’s lines
and veils, sometimes these topics can be mistakenly
breached—or someone might even realize in the middle
of a scene that they need to add a new topic to their lines
or veils. When that happens, everyone works together
to gently and efficiently cut the topic and move on.
```

```
Deciding as a Group
When your group is deciding on lines and veils, or
otherwise discussing topics to be mindful of, it’s okay to
eliminate any subjects you wish—even those related to
the Stormlight Archive. For example, you may want to limit
or omit various forms of discrimination from your group’s
Roshar. (When you do so, however, don’t do so by erasing
people or their identities! Rather, erase or challenge the
ideas and policies that harm them.)
If it helps, your group can draw inspiration from movie
rating systems (such as G, PG, PG-13, and R) to decide how
to handle topics like language, romance, abuse, gore, and
horror. For example, your group might want language to be
unrestricted but otherwise keep scenes PG-13. Whatever
you choose, just be sure you’re all on the  same page about
what that rating entails for each topic.
Your group might also decide to avoid specific
in-world discrimination on topics like mental illness,
speciesism, xenophobia, slavery, castes, gender roles,
gender identity, sexuality, eye shade, neurodivergence,
classism, and disability.
```

**362** Chapter 13: Gamemastering

```
Including Marginalization
Responsibly
Discrimination is a major theme on Roshar. Some
players may want to lean away from this for a more
lighthearted experience, while others may want to lean
into it. Use the following guidance when deconstructing
marginalization in gameplay.
```

```
Designate Space
In the Stormlight Archive books, we often witness
prejudice first through the perspective of the person it’s
aimed at. This shifts the priority and power away from
the perpetrator. The character might not outwardly stand
up for themselves, but taking a moment to share their
thought process and experience is powerful regardless.
Acknowledge and denounce harm by intentionally
allocating space in the narrative to unpack it.
If all players are okay exploring some aspects of
prejudice against player characters, consider doing
the following:
Seek Consent. Before any PC is marginalized, the GM
or player who is acting as “perpetrator” can check in
with the targeted player to ensure they’re aware of
and comfortable with the direction of the scene that’s
about to unfold.
Shift the Point of View. When a PC is hurt or dis-
criminated against by an NPC (or another PC), don’t
center the character who is doing harm in the scene.
Instead, give the player of the marginalized character
more time to show their character experiencing and
reacting to what was said or done.
Support Each Other. After a particularly tense scene,
it’s helpful for the GM and players to voice support
for a marginalized character (either in or out of
character).
These three approaches prevent glossing over—and
thus normalizing—hate speech, slurs, and other harmful
behaviors. (Real-life slurs are never appropriate to use
in gameplay.)
Use Caution With Interparty
Marginalization
In general, it’s not a good idea for characters to margin-
alize each other based on identities that face persecution
in real life (especially if the players don’t hold those same
identities). If a group unanimously feels that this kind of
interparty conflict is necessary for the stories they want
to tell, proceed with care and discuss beforehand any
marginalization that might occur between characters.
Regular check-ins are key to ward against game conflicts
bleeding into real life conflicts.
```

```
Topics to Consider
When discussing group safety, keep the following
general and setting-specific subjects topics in mind.
```

```
Slavery
The enslavement of singers and humans is common
in many nations on Roshar. Some nations, such as
Kharbranth, are against human slavery but don’t
protect the right of freedom for singers. When singers
are in what they refer to as slaveform, they’re only
obedient and docile as a survival mechanism. Slavery
isn’t enjoyable or okay for them, just as it isn’t enjoyable
or okay for anyone.
```

ARTUR MOSCA

```
Mental Illness
The Stormlight Archive novels feature many characters
with mental illnesses. Many of these challenges are
explored as the characters become Knights Radiant—
but this has nothing to do with mental illness itself.
Rather, the Nahel bond and journey of a Radiant
centers on personal growth in all areas. The need for
introspection and change is innate in all of us. This
need can come from various aspects of who we are,
and it doesn’t need to be rooted in a mental illness.
It’s also worth noting that mental illnesses are
sensitive and vulnerable topics, and they should never
be gamified for entertainment value. If you want to
build a character with a specific mental illness, do your
research, and check with the group whether this is safe
to explore at your table. Focus on the reality of living
with that mental illness, not stereotypes associated with
it. Does your character need this mental illness to tell
the story you want to tell? Or can it be told another way?
If you choose to proceed, do so with respect, sincerity,
and empathy.
```

```
Speciesism and Singers
Singers are the indigenous people of Roshar. At the
hands of humans, they’ve faced everything from
dismissal to slavery and genocide. Special consideration
should be given for their experiences.
Do players of singer characters want to de-emphasize
marginalization against their characters, or make
it a major theme and actively deconstruct it during
gameplay? (See “How to Include Marginalization
Responsibly.”) Does the mistreatment of singers
feel altogether too weighty or personal for players to
include at all? Either way, when discussing a game out
of character, the GM and players should always afford
singers the respect, empathy, and consideration humans
are given.
Discrimination Based on Eye Shade
The spectrum of eye colors for humans on Roshar
is different from our own. Both “darkeyes” and
“lighteyes” can have eyes in hues of violet, blue, green,
yellow, gray, and brown. While characters in-world
may describe these as differences in color, they’re
more accurately described as differences in shade. For
example, Szeth’s green eyes are “dark” and Amaram’s
tan eyes are “light.” Avoid assumptions that lighteyes
always have blue, green, or gray eyes, or that darkeyes
can only have brown or black eyes. Doing so helps
mitigate spillover from real-world racism and avoid
assumptions about physical traits based on race.
```

```
Gender Roles
Vorinism is one of many ideologies that impose strict
gender roles on its followers. Will your game include
details such as men’s illiteracy, the concealment of
women’s safe hands, and so on? In your Roshar, is
being an ardent the only way for gender-nonconforming
characters to avoid social persecution? What about
gender expectations based on other organizations
and cultures?
```

```
Gender Identity
Breathing in Stormlight over time can passively heal the
body of a Radiant to reflect a sex other than the one they
were assigned at birth, as discussed in the “Unifying
With Your Spiritual Self” sidebar in chapter 5. For
non-Radiant characters, what do they do when their
assigned genders don’t reflect who they are?
Casteism and Classism
Vorin nations such as Jah Keved and Alethkar assign
social standing based on eye shade, and many other
examples of casteism and classism exist throughout
Roshar. How prevalent will these themes be in
your game?
```

```
Sexuality
Many cultures in Roshar only acknowledge hetero-
sexual and monogamous partnerships. But in your
Roshar, there might not be social implications for being
open about your character’s sexuality, including which
genders they’re attracted to and how they experience
romantic and sexual attraction (if at all). These only
need to be a source of tension if your group wants
them to be.
Singers, humans, and spren may experience
attraction outside of their species. If you explore this,
take care to acknowledge power dynamics and avoid
exoticizing or fetishizing interspecies partnerships.
Asexuality
All populations on Roshar, regardless of their species
and culture, include a spectrum of asexual people.
Herdazian culture has a long tradition of valuing people
who aren’t interested in sex or producing offspring.
Singers, excluding when in mate form, aren’t expected
to show any interest in sex.
```

```
Disability
Players of disabled characters are empowered to control
their own character’s narrative, and it’s wholly up to
them what additional limitations they experience.
If a player wishes, they can work with the GM to
determine a reasonable mechanic implication, if any,
```

**364** Chapter 13: Gamemastering

```
for a disability; this can happen during character
creation or after a session in which their character
has been disabled. Or a player might wish their
character to have no impairment, and to inhabit a
world that’s fully accommodating and accessible
for a wide range of differently abled bodies.
Abuse
Abuse can extend far beyond the stereotypes of purely
physical abuse. Are there situations where violence,
verbal abuse, power imbalances, and emotionally
manipulative behaviors should be omitted or veiled,
such as against children, between family members,
or among other vulnerable groups?
```

```
Gore and Horror
Seeing gore in real life can be extremely traumatic.
Fictional gore can trigger memories of real gore or
invite intrusive images and thoughts. What level of gore
is everyone comfortable with? For example, your group
might agree to not go beyond mentions of blood and
intact corpses. As with all other topics, lines and veils
around gore should be taken seriously.
Similarly, consider what other aspects of horror
are or aren’t conducive to a fun game for the group.
Profanity
Do the ages or preferences of players call for mild
language, or is everyone comfortable with swearing?
Do in-world phrases such as “Storm you!” and
“Oh, for Yaezir’s sake!” count as profanity?
```

```
Intimacy and Consent
Special consideration and caution are warranted
when including intimacy in gameplay. Be careful to
give advance notice, discuss limits and when to “fade
to black,” and frequently check in during gameplay
to make sure everyone is still comfortable. At the
slightest sign of discomfort in any players, end the
scene and move on.
The GM and players should never have their
characters intimately touch another character without
that character’s clear, enthusiastic consent. Some players
may find flirty, romantic, or sexually suggestive scenes
uncomfortable, and they can request these scenes be
veiled or omitted entirely. (It’s also important to note
that attraction and consent between characters doesn’t
translate to attraction or consent between players.)
Limits around sexual content should apply
universally, regardless of the genders of the characters
involved. While each player’s comfort is paramount,
this never warrants double standards for lines and veils
around intimacy.
```

```
Intersectionality
When considering marginalization and oppression, it’s
important to think about intersectionality. Experiencing
multiple forms of discrimination has a cumulative effect
on a person’s life, impacting them in ways far more
complex than the sum of their parts. This experience
influences the identity of both player and character,
potentially changing how they can comfortably interact
with Rosharan society and the wider game.
```

```
Depicting a Changing World
During the True Desolation era, societies across Roshar
face massive upheaval. In Alethkar alone, Queen Jasnah
has abolished slavery, the newly refounded Knights
Radiant have upended rigid gender roles, and society
is moving away from the caste system of “lighteyes”
and “darkeyes.”
When choosing how much to include marginalization
in your game, keep in mind that during the total war of
the True Desolation, there are many in-world reasons
for NPCs not to dwell on an individual character’s
ancestry, gender, sexuality, etc. Discriminatory ideo-
logies don’t just vanish overnight or cease to cause harm,
but they may become less pronounced as many unite
toward a common goal.

###### Unite Them!

```
Once you’ve found your players, it’s time to plan your
first game. Beforehand, take time for a “session zero”
to make sure everyone is on the same page about the
game’s content, tone, and safety tools, as discussed in
chapter 13. (While a live session is optimal, this type of
discussion can also take place via email or messaging.)
If players are newer to RPGs, a session zero can also
be a good time to help players build their characters.
Allow at least an hour for a session zero.
To prepare for the session, make sure you’re familiar
with the rules. Visit CosmereRPG.com to print out quick
reference sheets for players. If you’re playing with battle
maps, be ready with miniatures or tokens and printed
maps or dry-erase mats. Prepare a comfortable place to
play and gather together.
Once everyone is ready to play, it’s time for your
first full gameplay session! You can meet in person,
via video, or by using VTT (virtual tabletop) software.
For your first session, it’s a good idea to set aside a
couple of hours (or more) and to keep an eye on the
time. The GM’s role is to keep the action moving
forward and make sure every player has a chance to
contribute. Don’t expect your first session to be perfect,
but as long as everyone stays engaged, it should be a
memorable experience!

###### Gather Your Party

```
The Cosmere RPG was designed to be approachable
for a wide range of players, including those unfamiliar
with the Stormlight Archive novels. Most groups will
include players who are experiencing Roshar for the
first time. When recruiting such players, you can pitch
it as “an epic fantasy world with a unique magic system
in which a character’s Ideals unlock powerful abilities.”
New players may also be intrigued by the fact that
characters gain powers by forming bonds with spirit-
like beings called “spren.” You can also engage players
by explaining that this RPG is part of the broader
cosmere, a universe where each world has its own
history, culture, and magic system.
```

```
Existing Roleplayers
For fans of other tabletop RPGs, the Cosmere RPG
offers a balance of traditional rules and narrative
innovations. The core mechanic of d20-based skill
tests will be familiar to most players, but other
features (flexible paths, the plot die, and the order of
combat) may feel fresh. Whether a potential player
prefers tactical dungeon delving or character-driven
improvisation, the Cosmere RPG can support
different preferences and playstyles.
```

```
New Roleplayers
This RPG was also designed for Stormlight fans
who aren’t familiar with tabletop roleplaying. If this
is your first tabletop RPG, consider beginning with

When it comes to looking up specific lore on the fly,
we know of no better resource than the Coppermind.net
wiki. Maintained by the official Brandon Sanderson fan
site, 17thShard.com , the Coppermind is a great way to
look up specific details about any location, individual,
or item in Roshar and beyond. Members of the 17th
Shard provided crucial advice and lore expertise during
the creation of this game, and the Coppermind is an
invaluable resource for anyone who wants to learn more
about the works of Brandon Sanderson.

###### Beyond Stormlight

```
The windswept, war-torn world of Roshar could
provide enough material to support years of adventure
across multiple campaigns. However, Roshar is just
one world in an entire universe of magic, conflict,
and character-driven storytelling.
The Stormlight Handbook is part of the larger
Cosmere RPG. As this system expands, it’ll grow to
encompass Mistborn adventures in Scadrial, intrigue in
the Cognitive Realm city of Silverlight, and other worlds
with their own unique magic systems. Everything within
the Cosmere RPG is written for cross-compatibility.
A party of worldhoppers could include a Radiant, an
artifabrian, a Twinborn, and a sand master ... and their
adventures could take them across the cosmere.
Roshar, a world hardened by millennia of war,
is about to be thrown into a universe-wide conflict.
Who are the heroes when the champions of different
worlds collide? Who will emerge victorious? That story
becomes your story in the Cosmere RPG, and there’s
always another secret, so visit CosmereRPG.com to

###### Using Animal Companions

```
When you complete a goal, the GM can reward you
with an animal companion; this reward allows you to
befriend and train a particular animal. Having such an
animal companion also meets the prerequisites for the
Hunter path’s Animal Bond talent.
The following section presents companion stat
blocks for some of the most common Rosharan animals,
organized by tier. Following these stat blocks, you can
find guidance on modifying them to represent other
animals. Finally, this appendix presents a special profile
for a unique creature: the larkin.
```

```
Reading a Stat Block
Animal companions follow the “Using Adversaries”
rules in chapter 13 of this book. Like other stat blocks,
your companion can also use the actions, free actions,
and reactions in chapter 10; for example, to move, they
use the Move action.
```

```
Your Companion’s Behavior
As with other NPCs, an animal companion is
controlled by the GM, unless an effect (like the
Hunter’s Animal Bond talent) gives you some ability
to dictate their actions. However, your animal
companion generally acts in your best interests and
as your character requests, though a companion
won’t act against their own instincts.
```

```
Dropping to 0 Health
When your animal companion drops to 0 health,
they fall Unconscious, much like a PC. Unlike a PC,
however, your companion can’t voluntarily regain
consciousness. Instead, your companion can only be
revived by recovering at least 1 health from another
source, or by rolling a recovery die during a short rest.
If your companion falls Unconscious in a place where
they can’t be safely recovered, it’s up to the GM what
happens to them; depending on the circumstances,
they might be permanently lost.

###### Customizing Stat Blocks

The animal profiles presented in the previous sections
and within the World Guide are only a small sampling of
iconic creatures from Roshar’s rich ecology. If you want
to represent other beasts in your adventures, with your
GM’s permission, you can modify an existing stat block
from this chapter, or you can modify an adversary stat
block from the _Stormlight World Guide_.
To do so, rename the stat block to the desired
animal, then work with your GM to either add new
skills, features, and abilities, or to replace existing ones,
sculpting statistics that are a good fit for that animal.
Be sure to remove any features that aren’t a good fit
for the desired animal. As a general rule, for each skill,
beneficial feature, or custom action you add to your
companion’s stat block, you should remove or decrease
an existing one. Unless your GM says otherwise, the
modified stat block should be roughly as powerful after
the changes as it was before them. Additionally, if your
animal companion uses an adversary stat block from the
_Stormlight World Guide_ , remove any Opportunities and
Complications section, as that section doesn’t apply to
companion stat blocks.

Example Customizations

The following sections suggest features and actions
you could apply to your animal companion, followed
by examples of how you could adapt specific stat blocks
to represent another animal.

Example Features
The following features can aid in representing
various Rosharan fauna. Some of these features offer
multiple options to pick from; you can choose these
features more than once, picking a different effect
each time. For example, you could pick both the
Aquatic and Climber features, which affects your
companion both when swimming and climbing.
These features are intended as inspiration and they
aren’t all-encompassing, so feel free to work with
your GM to create new ones.

**Aquatic/Climber/Furtive/Spry (choose one).**
Swimming/climbing/sneaking/difficult terrain (choose
one) doesn’t cause the animal to become Slowed.
**Carapace/Shell.** Increase the animal’s deflect
value by +2.
**Enhanced Senses.** The animal gains an advantage on
non-attack tests that rely on their primary sense.

```
Evasive/Skyborn/Slippery (choose one). The animal
doesn’t trigger Reactive Strikes while moving/flying/
swimming (choose one).
Fleet. Increase one or more of the animal’s movement
rate by 10 feet.
Flight. Grant the animal a flying rate of 30 feet.
Hearty. Increase the animal’s health by 10.
Jumper. The animal can jump twice as far as usual
without making a test.
Nimble. The animal can move through enemy spaces
and can end their turn in the same space as a willing
character. While occupying the same space as another
character, the animal can’t be grazed and attacks
against the animal gain a disadvantage.
Skilled. The animal gains an additional skill rank in one
skill of your choice. This increases to two additional
ranks when you reach tier 2, and to three additional
ranks when you reach tier 3.
Sleek. The animal counts as one size smaller when
squeezing through smaller spaces.
Example Actions
If you’d like to adjust a stat block’s actions to better fit a
different animal, that can be as simple as renaming the
action or changing its damage type. For more significant
changes, consider the following ideas:
Powerful Attack. Increase the size of one attack’s
damage dice (for example, from a d4 to a d6).
Venomous Attack. Add the following effect to one
attack: On a hit, the animal can spend 1 focus to cause
the target to become Afflicted [1d4 vital] until the
target regains at least 1 health.
```

```
Example Stat Block Changes
To inspire your own modifications, this section presents
examples of how you could adjust the stat blocks
presented earlier to create a new animal companion.
All features added in these examples appear in
“Example Features.”
Axehind
To create an axehind, make the following changes
to the  horse stat block:
```

◆ (^) Add Carapace (+2 deflect).
◆ (^) Add the Jumper feature (doubling the horse’s
jump distance).
◆ (^) Remove the Kick action.
◆ (^) Reduce their movement rate by 10 feet (to 30 feet).
Appendix: Animal Companions **371**

```
Hunting Chicken (Hawk)
To create a hunting chicken, make the following changes
to the skyeel stat block:
```

◆ (^) Change their size to Small.
◆ (^) Add the Fleet feature (increasing their flying rate
by 10 feet).
◆ (^) Add the Skyborn feature (avoiding Reactive Strikes
while flying).
◆ (^) Make their Bite action more powerful by increasing
the damage die from 1d4 to 1d6 (see “Example
Actions”).
◆ (^) Remove their ability to spend focus on their
Bite action for an additional effect.
◆ (^) Remove their swim movement rate.
◆ (^) Remove the Slippery feature.
◆ (^) Change the Dive Bomb action so the hunting chicken
can spend 1 focus to continue flying.
**Poison Cremling**
To create a poison cremling, make the following changes
to the **mink** stat block:
◆ (^) Add Carapace (+2 deflect).
◆ (^) Make their Bite action venomous (see “Example
Actions”).
◆ (^) Remove the Enhanced Senses feature.
◆ (^) Remove the Furtive feature.
**Sarpenth**
To create a sarpenth, make the following changes
to the  **mink** stat block:
◆ (^) Add the Aquatic feature (allowing them to swim
without becoming Slowed).
◆ (^) Add the Skilled feature (choosing Intimidation
as the skill).
◆ (^) Add the Sleek feature (helping them squeeze
through smaller spaces).
◆ (^) Remove the Agility skill ranks.
◆ (^) Remove the Enhanced Senses feature.
◆ (^) Remove the Furtive feature.

###### Special Companion: Larkin

```
Larkin are critically endangered creatures who were
associated with the Knights Radiant before the Era of
Solitude. These lithe crustaceans have narrow faces,
eyes of pure silver, and wings that fold from their
backs. Their most defining characteristic, though, is
their ability to feed on Investiture: a larkin can drain
Light from gems, fabrials, and even living beings (like
Radiants and Fused). It is speculated that they may
be able to consume other forms of Investiture as well.
Though larkin are able to subsist for a short time on
more standard foodstuffs, they become weak and sickly
if they don’t consume Light for an extended period.
Modern larkin are diminutive, generally between the
length of an adult hand and forearm. However, once
a larkin consumes enough Investiture in their lifetime,
they can be returned to their ancestral homeland to
attain the next stage of growth. This allows them to
grow larger and stronger, and scholars believe that a
larkin may be able to do this several times, though this
hasn’t been proven.
```

```
Gaining a Larkin
A larkin can be given as a reward for a character of any
tier. However, due to their extreme rarity, it’s highly
unlikely that more than one character in a campaign
could obtain a larkin companion.
```

```
Growing Your Larkin
If you are tier 3 or higher and you have a larkin
companion, the GM can offer you the goal “Grow
Your Larkin.” To complete this goal, you must brave
the dangerous journey to the ruins of Aimia with
your larkin, allow them to bond with a special type of
luckspren, and return alive. The tier 3 reward for this
is your larkin molting into a greater larkin.

Drain Light. If the larkin isn’t at full Investiture, they
choose one of the following targets within 5 feet of them,
draining the chosen target of power:
```

◆ (^) **Object with Charges.** A fabrial or other object with
charges loses 2 (1d4) charges.
◆ (^) **Group of Spheres.** Up to 2 (1d4) infused marks or

that character’s Spiritual defense or the target isn’t drained.
The larkin regains the same amount of Investiture as
they drained from the target. A character wearing Invested
Shardplate can’t have their Investiture drained in this way,

automatically succeeds on their Agility test to do so.
**Invested Enhancement (Costs 1 Investiture).** The larkin
becomes Enhanced [Strength +1] and Enhanced [Speed +1]
until the end of their next turn. This temporarily increases
each of their Physical skills by 1, including their Bite action’s
attack and damage rolls. At the end of each of the larkin’s
turns, they can spend 1 Investiture to maintain this effect for
an additional round.
**Drain Light.** If the larkin isn’t at full Investiture, they
choose one of the following targets within 10 feet of them,
draining the chosen target of power:
◆ (^) **Object with Charges.** A fabrial or other object with
charges loses 3 (1d6) charges.
◆ (^) **Group of Spheres.** Up to 3 (1d6) infused marks or
